nt anywhere there was nothing else for it excuse me harry said to the plump woman hello dear she said first time at hogwarts rons new too she pointed at the last and youngest of her sons he was tall thin and gangling with freckles big hands and feet and a long nose yes said harry the thing is  the thing is i dont know how to  how to get onto the platform she said kindly and harry nodded not to worry she said all you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten dont stop and dont be scared youll crash into it thats very important best do it at a bit of a run if youre nervous go on go now before ron er  okay said harry he pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier it looked very solid he started to walk toward it people jostled him on their way to platforms nine and ten harry walked more quickly he was going to smash right into that barrier and then hed be in trouble  leaning forward on his cart he broke into a heavy run  the barrier was coming nearer and nearer  he wouldnt be able to stop  the cart was out of control  he was a foot away  he closed his eyes ready for the crash  it didnt come he kept on running he opened his eyes a scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people a sign overhead said hogwarts express eleven oclock harry looked behind him and saw a wroughtiron archway where the barrier had been with the words platform nine and threequarters on it he had done it smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs owls hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of heavy trunks the first few carriages were already packed with students some hanging out of the window to talk to their families some fighting over seats harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat he passed a roundfaced boy who was saying gran ive lost my toad again oh neville he heard the old woman sigh a boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd give us a look lee go on the boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms and the people around him shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long hairy leg harry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment near the end of the train he put hedwig inside first and then started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door he tried to lift it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it painfully on his foot want a hand it was one of the redhaired twins hed followed through the barrier yes please harry panted oy fred cmere and help with the twins help harrys trunk was at last tucked away in a corner of the compartment thanks said harry pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes whats that said one of the twins suddenly pointing at harrys lightning scar blimey said the other twin are you he is said the first twin arent you he added to harry what said harry harry potter chorused the twins oh him said harry i mean yes i am the two boys gawked at him and harry felt himself turning red then to his relief a voice came floating in through the trains open door fred george are you there coming mom with a last look at harry the twins hopped off the train harry sat down next to the window where half hidden he could watch the redhaired family on the platform and hear what they were saying their mother had just taken out her handkerchief ron youve got something on your nose the youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way but she grabbed him and began rubbing the end of his nose mom  geroff he wriggled free aaah has ickle ronnie got somefink on his nosie said one of the twins shut up said ron wheres percy said their mother hes coming now the oldest boy came striding into sight he had already changed into his billowing black hogwarts robes and harry noticed a shiny silver badge on his chest with the letter p on it cant stay long mother he said im up front the prefects have got two compartments to themselves  oh are you a prefect percy said one of the twins with an air of great surprise you should have said something we had no idea hang on i think i remember him saying something about it said the other twin once  or twice  a minute  all summer  oh shut up said percy the prefect how come percy gets new robes anyway said one of the twins because hes a prefect said their mother fondly all right dear well have a good term  send me an owl when you get there she kissed percy on the cheek and he left then she turned to the twins now

and look after ron dont worry ickle ronniekins is safe with us shut up said ron again he was almost as tall as the twins already and his nose was still pink where his mother had rubbed it hey mom guess what guess who we just met on the train harry leaned back quickly so they couldnt see him looking you know that blackhaired boy who was near us in the station know who he is who harry potter harry heard the little girls voice oh mom can i go on the train and see him mom eh please youve already seen him ginny and the poor boy isnt something you goggle at in a zoo is he really fred how do you know asked him saw his scar its really there  like lightning poor dear  no wonder he was alone i wondered he was ever so polite when he asked how to get onto the platform never mind that do you think he remembers what youknowwho looks like their mother suddenly became very stern i forbid you to ask him fred no dont you dare as though he needs reminding of that on his first day at school all right keep your hair on a whistle sounded hurry up their mother said and the three boys clambered onto the train they leaned out of the window for her to kiss them goodbye and their younger sister began to cry dont ginny well send you loads of owls well send you a hogwarts toilet seat george only joking mom the train began to move harry saw the boys mother waving and their sister half laughing half crying running to keep up with the train until it gathered too much speed then she fell back and waved harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the corner houses flashed past the window harry felt a great leap of excitement he didnt know what he was going to but it had to be better than what he was leaving behind the door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy came in anyone sitting there he asked pointing at the seat opposite harry everywhere else is full harry shook his head and the boy sat down he glanced at harry and then looked quickly out of the window pretending he hadnt looked harry saw he still had a black mark on his nose hey ron the twins were back listen were going down the middle of the train  lee jordans got a giant tarantula down there right mumbled ron harry said the other twin did we introduce ourselves fred and george weasley and this is ron our brother see you later then bye said harry and ron the twins slid the compartment door shut behind them are you really harry potter ron blurted out harry nodded oh well i thought it might be one of fred and georges jokes said ron and have you really got  you know he pointed at harrys forehead harry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar ron stared so thats where youknowwho yes said harry but i cant remember it nothing said ron eagerly well  i remember a lot of green light but nothing else wow said ron he sat and stared at harry for a few moments then as though he had suddenly realized what he was doing he looked quickly out of the window again are all your family wizards asked harry who found ron just as interesting as ron found him er  yes i think so said ron i think moms got a second cousin whos an accountant but we never talk about him so you must know loads of magic already the weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale boy in diagon alley had talked about i heard you went to live with muggles said ron what are they like horrible well not all of them my aunt and uncle and cousin are though wish id had three wizard brothers five said ron for some reason he was looking gloomy im the sixth in our family to go to hogwarts you could say ive got a lot to live up to bill and charlie have already left  bill was head boy and charlie was captain of quidditch now percys a prefect fred and george mess around a lot but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks theyre really funny everyone expects me to do as well as the others but if i do its no big deal because they did it first you never get anything new either with five brothers ive got bills old robes charlies old wand and percys old rat ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat which was asleep his names scabbers and hes useless he hardly ever wakes up percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect but they couldnt aff  i mean i got scabbers instead rons ears went pink he seemed to think hed said too much because he went back to staring out of the window harry didnt think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl after all hed never had any money in his life until a month ago and he told ron so all about having to wear dudleys old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents this seemed to cheer ron up  and until hagrid told me i didnt know anything about be ing a wizard or about my parents or voldemort ron gasped what said harry you said youknowwhos name said ron sounding both shocked and impressed id have thought you of all people  im not trying to be brave or anything saying the name said harry i just never knew you shouldnt see what i mean ive got loads to learn i bet he added voicing for the first time something that had been worrying him a lot lately i bet im the worst in the class you wont be theres loads of people who come from muggle families and they learn quick enough while they had been talking the train had carried them out of london now they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep they were quiet for a time watching the fields and lanes flick past around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling dimpled woman slid back their door and said anything off the cart dears harry who hadnt had any breakfast leapt to his feet but rons ears went pink again and he muttered that hed brought sandwiches harry went out into the corridor he had never had any money for candy with the dursleys and now that he had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many mars bars as he could carry  but the woman didnt have mars bars what she did have were bettie botts every flavor beans droobles best blowing gum chocolate frogs pumpkin pasties cauldron cakes licorice wands and a number of other strange things harry had never seen in his life not wanting to miss anything he got some of everything and paid the woman eleven silver sickles and seven bronze knuts ron stared as harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped it onto an empty seat hungry are you starving said harry taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty ron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it there were four sandwiches inside he pulled one of them apart and said she always forgets i dont like corned beef swap you for one of these said harry holding up a pasty go on  you dont want this its all dry said ron she hasnt got much time he added quickly you know with five of us go on have a pasty said harry who had never had anything to share before or indeed anyone to share it with it was a nice feeling sitting there with ron eating their way through all harrys pasties cakes and candies the sandwiches lay forgotten what are these harry asked ron holding up a pack of chocolate frogs theyre not really frogs are they he was starting to feel that nothing would surprise him no said ron but see what the card is im missing agrippa what oh of course you wouldnt know  chocolate frogs have cards inside them you know to collect  famous witches and wizards ive got about five hundred but i havent got agrippa or ptolemy harry unwrapped his chocolate frog and picked up the card it showed a mans face he wore half moon glasses had a long crooked nose and flowing silver hair beard and mustache underneath the picture was the name albus dumbledore so this is dumbledore said harry dont tell me youd never heard of dumbledore said ron can i have a frog i might get agrippa  thanks harry turned over his card and read albus dumbledore currently headmaster of hogwarts considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard grindelwald in 1945 for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragons blood and his work on alchemy with his partner nicolas flamel professor dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling harry turned the card back over and saw to his astonishment that dumbledores face had disappeared hes gone well you cant expect him to hang around all day said ron hell be back no ive got morgana again and ive got about six of her do you want it you can start collecting rons eyes strayed to the pile of chocolate frogs waiting to be unwrapped help yourself said harry but in you know the muggle world people just stay put in photos do they what they dont move at all ron sounded amazed weird harry stared as dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and gave him a small smile ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the famous witches and wizards cards but harry couldnt keep his eyes off them soon he had not only dumbledore and morgana but hengist of woodcroft alberic grunnion circe paracelsus and merlin he finally tore his eyes away from the druidess cliodna who was scratching her nose to open a bag of bertie botts every flavor beans you want to be careful with those ron warned harry when they say every flavor they mean every flavor  you know you get all the ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and mar malade but then you can get spinach and liver and tripe george reckons he had a booger flavored one once ron picked up a green bean looked at it carefully and bit into a corner bleaaargh  see sprouts they had a good time eating the every flavor beans harry got toast coconut baked bean strawberry curry grass coffee sardine and was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one ron wouldnt touch which turned out to be pepper the countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder the neat fields had gone now there were woods twisting rivers and dark green hills there was a knock on the door of their compartment and the roundfaced boy harry had passed on platform nine and threequarters came in he looked tearful sorry he said but have you seen a toad at all when they shook their heads he wailed ive lost him he keeps getting away from me hell turn up said harry yes said the boy miserably well if you see him he left dont know why hes so bothered said ron if id brought a toad id lose it as quick as i could mind you i brought scabbers so i cant talk the rat was still snoozing on rons lap he might have died and you wouldnt know the difference said ron in disgust i tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting but the spell didnt work ill show you look he rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very batteredlooking wand it was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the end unicorn hairs nearly poking out anyway he had just raised his wand when the compartment door slid open again the toadless boy was back but this time he had a girl with him she was already wearing her new hogwarts robes has anyone seen a toad nevilles lost one she said she had a bossy sort of voice lots of bushy brown hair and rather large front teeth weve already told him we havent seen it said ron but the girl wasnt listening she was looking at the wand in his hand oh are you doing magic lets see it then she sat down ron looked taken aback er  all right he cleared his throat sunshine daisies butter mellow turn this stupid fat rat yellow he waved his wand but nothing happened scabbers stayed gray and fast asleep are you sure thats a real spell said the girl well its not very good is it ive tried a few simple spells just for practice and its all worked for me nobody in my familys magic at all it was ever such a surprise when i got my letter but i was ever so pleased of course i mean its the very best school of witchcraft there is ive heard  ive learned all our course books by heart of course i just hope it will be enough  im hermione granger by the way who are you she said all this very fast harry looked at ron and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he hadnt learned all the course books by heart either im ron weasley ron muttered harry potter said harry are you really said hermione i know all about you of course  i got a few extra books for background reading and youre in modern magical history and the rise and fall of the dark arts and great wizarding events of the twentieth century am i said harry feeling dazed goodness didnt you know id have found out everything i could if it was me said hermione do either of you know what house youll be in ive been asking around and i hope im in gryffindor it sounds by far the best i hear dumbledore himself was in it but i suppose ravenclaw wouldnt be too bad anyway wed better go and look for nevilles toad you two had better change you know i expect well be there soon and she left taking the toadless boy with her whatever house im in i hope shes not in it said ron he threw his wand back into his trunk stupid spell  george gave it to me bet he knew it was a dud what house are your brothers in asked harry gryffindor said ron gloom seemed to be settling on him again mom and dad were in it too i dont know what theyll say if im not i dont suppose ravenclaw would be too bad but imagine if they put me in slytherin thats the house vol i mean youknowwho was in yeah said ron he flopped back into his seat looking depressed you know i think the ends of scabbers whiskers are a bit lighter said harry trying to take rons mind off houses so what do your oldest brothers do now that theyve left anyway harry was wondering what a wizard did once hed finished school charlies in romania studying dragons and bills in africa doing something for gringotts said ron did you hear about gringotts its been all over the daily prophet but i dont suppose you get that with the muggles  someone tried to rob a high security vault harry stared really what happened to them nothing thats why its such big news they havent been caught my dad says it mustve been a powerful dark wizard to get round gringotts but they dont think they took anything thats whats odd course everyone gets scared when something like this happens in case youknowwhos behind it harry turned this news over in his mind he was starting to get a prickle of fear every time you knowwho was mentioned he supposed this was all part of entering the magical world but it had been a lot more comfortable saying voldemort without worrying whats your quidditch team ron asked er  i dont know any harry confessed what ron looked dumbfounded oh you wait its the best game in the world  and he was off explaining all about the four balls and the positions of the seven players describing famous games hed been to with his brothers and the broomstick hed like to get if he had the money he was just taking harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again but it wasnt neville the toadless boy or hermione granger this time three boys entered and harry recognized the middle one at once it was the pale boy from madam malkins robe shop he was looking at harry with a lot more interest than hed shown back in diagon alley is it true he said theyre saying all down the train that harry potters in this compartment so its you is it yes said harry he was looking at the other boys both of them were thickset and looked extremely mean standing on either side of the pale boy they looked like bodyguards oh this is crabbe and this is goyle said the pale boy carelessly noticing where harry was looking and my names malfoy draco malfoy ron gave a slight cough which might have been hiding a snigget draco malfoy looked at him think my names funny do you no need to ask who you are my father told me all the weasleys have red hair freckles and more children than they can afford he turned back to harry youll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others potter you dont want to go making friends with the wrong sort i can help you there he held out his hand to shake harrys but harry didnt take it i think i can tell who the wrong sort are for myself thanks he said coolly draco malfoy didnt go red but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeks id be careful if i were you potter he said slowly unless youre a bit politer youll go the same way as your parents they didnt know what was good for them either you hang around with riffraff like the weasleys and that hagrid and itll rub off on you both harry and ron stood up say that again ron said his face as red as his hair oh youre going to fight us are you malfoy sneered unless you get out now said harry more bravely than he felt because crabbe and goyle were a lot bigger than him or ron but we dont feet like leaving do we boys weve eaten all our food and you still seem to have some goyle reached toward the chocolate frogs next to ron  ron leapt forward but before hed so much as touched goyle goyle let out a horrible yell scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger sharp little teeth sunk deep into goyles knuckle  crabbe and malfoy backed away as goyle swung scabbers round and round howling and when scabbets finally flew off and hit the window all three of them disappeared at once perhaps they thought there were more rats lurking among the sweets or perhaps theyd heard footsteps because a second later hermione granger had come in what has been going on she said looking at the sweets all over the floor and ron picking up scabbers by his tail i think hes been knocked out ron said to harry he looked closer at scabbers no  i dont believe it  hes gone back to sleep and so he had youve met malfoy before harry explained about their meeting in diagon alley ive heard of his family said ron darkly they were some of the first to come back to our side after youknowwho disappeared said theyd been bewitched my dad doesnt believe it he says malfoys father didnt need an excuse to go over to the dark side he turned to hermione can we help you with something youd better hurry up and put your robes on ive just been up to the front to ask the conductor and he says were nearly there you havent been fighting have you youll be in trouble before we even get there scabbers has been fighting not us said ron scowling at her would you mind leaving while we change all right  i only came in here because people outside are behaving very childishly racing up and down the corridors said hermione in a sniffy voice and youve got dirt on your nose by the way did you know ron glared at her as she left harry peered out of the window it was getting dark he could see mountains and forests under a deep purple sky the train did seem to be slowing down he and ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robes rons were a bit short for him you could see his sneakers underneath them a voice echoed through the train we will be reaching hogwarts in five minutes time please leave your luggage on the train it will be taken to the school separately harrys stomach lurched with nerves and ron he saw looked pale under his freckles they crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and joined the crowd thronging the corridor the train slowed right down and finally stopped people pushed their way toward the door and out on to a tiny dark platform harry shivered in the cold night air then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students and harry heard a familiar voice firs years firs years over here all right there harry hagrids big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads cmon follow me  any more firs years mind yer step now firs years follow me slipping and stumbling they followed hagrid down what seemed to be a steep narrow path it was so dark on either side of them that harry thought there must be thick trees there nobody spoke much neville the boy who kept losing his toad sniffed once or twice ye all get yer firs sight o hogwarts in a sec hagrid called over his shoulder jus round this bend here there was a loud oooooh the narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black take perched atop a high mountain on the other side its windows sparkling in the starry sky was a vast castle with many turrets and towers no moren four to a boat hagrid called pointing to a fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore harry and ron were followed into their boat by neville and hermione everyone in shouted hagrid who had a boat to himself right then  forward and the fleet of little boats moved off all at once gliding across the lake which was as smooth as glass everyone was silent staring up at the great castle overhead it towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood heads down yelled hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face they were carried along a dark tunnel which seemed to be taking them right underneath the castle until they reached a kind of underground harbor where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles oy you there is this your toad said hagrid who was checking the boats as people climbed out of them trevor cried neville blissfully holding out his hands then they clambered up a passageway in the rock after hagrids lamp coming out at last onto smooth damp grass right in the shadow of the castle they walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge oak front door everyone here you there still got yer toad hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle door chapter seven the sorting hat the door swung open at once a tall blackhaired witch in emeraldgreen robes stood there she had a very stern face and harrys first thought was that this was not someone to cross the firs years professor mcgonagall said hagrid thank you hagrid i will take them from here she pulled the door wide the entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the dursleys house in it the stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at gringotts the ceiling was too high to make out and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floors they followed professor mcgonagall across the flagged stone floor harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right the rest of the school must already be here  but professor mcgonagall showed the first years into a small empty chamber off the hall they crowded in standing rather closer together than they would usually have done peering about nervously welcome to hogwarts said professor mcgonagall the startofterm banquet will begin shortly but before you take your seats in the great hall you will be sorted into your houses the sorting is a very important ceremony because while you are here your house will be something like your family within hogwarts you will have classes with the rest of your house sleep in your house dormitory and spend free time in your house common room the four houses are called gryffindor hufflepuff ravenclaw and slytherin each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards while you are at hogwarts your triumphs will earn your house points while any rulebreaking will lose house points at the end of the year the house with the most points is awarded the house cup a great honor i hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours the sorting ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school i suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting her eyes lingered for a moment on nevilles cloak which was fastened under his left ear and on rons smudged nose harry nervously tried to flatten his hair i shall return when we are ready for you said professor mcgonagall please wait quietly she left the chamber harry swallowed how exactly do they sort us into houses he asked ron some sort of test i think fred said it hurts a lot but i think he was joking harrys heart gave a horrible jolt a test in front of the whole school but he didnt know any magic yet  what on earth would he have to do he hadnt expected something like this the moment they arrived he looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified too no one was talking much except hermione granger who was whispering very fast about all the spells shed learned and wondering which one shed need harry tried hard not to listen to her hed never been more nervous never not even when hed had to take a school report home to the dursleys saying that hed somehow turned his teachers wig blue he kept his eyes fixed on the door any second now professor mcgonagall would come back and lead him to his doom then something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air  several people behind him screamed what the  he gasped so did the people around him about twenty ghosts had just streamed through the back wall pearlywhite and slightly transparent they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years they seemed to be arguing what looked like a fat little monk was saying forgive and forget i say we ought to give him a second chance  my dear friar havent we given peeves all the chances he deserves he gives us all a bad name and you know hes not really even a ghost  i say what are you all doing here a ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years nobody answered new students said the fat friar smiling around at them about to be sorted i suppose a few people nodded mutely hope to see you in hufflepuff said the friar my old house you know move along now said a sharp voice the sorting ceremonys about to start professor mcgonagall had returned one by one the ghosts floated away through the opposite wall now form a line professor mcgonagall told the first years and follow me feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair with ron behind him and they walked out of the chamber back across the hall and through a pair of double doors into the great hall harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place it was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables where the rest of the students were sitting these tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets at the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting professor mcgonagall led the first years up here so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students with the teachers behind them the hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight dotted here and there among the students the ghosts shone misty silver mainly to avoid all the staring eyes harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars he heard hermione whisper its bewitched to look like the sky outside i read about it in hogwarts a history it was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all and that the great hall didnt simply open on to the heavens harry quickly looked down again as professor mcgonagall silently placed a fourlegged stool in front of the first years on top of the stool she put a pointed wizards hat this hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty aunt petunia wouldnt have let it in the house maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it harry thought wildly that seemed the sort of thing  noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat he stared at it too for a few seconds there was complete silence then the hat twitched a rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth  and the hat began to sing oh you may not think im pretty but dont judge on what you see ill eat myself if you can find a smarter hat than me you can keep your bowlers black your top hats sleek and tall for im the hogwarts sorting hat and i can cap them all theres nothing hidden in your head the sorting hat cant see so try me on and i will tell you where you ought to be you might belong in gryffindor where dwell the brave at heart their daring nerve and chivalry set gryffindors apart you might belong in hufflepuff where they are just and loyal those patient hufflepuffis are true and unafraid of toil or yet in wise old ravenclaw if youve a ready mind where those of wit and learning will always find their kind or perhaps in slytherin youll make your real friends those cunning folk use any means to achieve their ends so put me on dont be afraid and dont get in a flap youre in safe hands though i have none for im a thinking cap the whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song it bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again so weve just got to try on the hat ron whispered to harry ill kill fred he was going on about wrestling a troll harry smiled weakly yes trying on the hat was a lot better than having to do a spell but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching the hat seemed to be asking rather alot harry didnt feel brave or quickwitted or any of it at the moment if only the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy that would have been the one for him professor mcgonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment when i call your name you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted she said abbott hannah a pinkfaced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line put on the hat which fell right down over her eyes and sat down a moments pause  hufflepuff shouted the hat the table on the right cheered and clapped as hannah went to sit down at the hufflepuff table harry saw the ghost of the fat friar waving merrily at her bones susan hufflepuff shouted the hat again and susan scuttled off to sit next to hannah boot terry ravenclaw the table second from the left clapped this time several ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with terry as he joined them  brocklehurst mandy went to ravenclaw too but brown lavender became the first new gryffindor and the table on the far left exploded with cheers harry could see rons twin brothers catcalling bulstrode millicent then became a slytherin perhaps it was harrys imagination after all hed heard about slytherin but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot he was starting to feel definitely sick now he remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school he had always been last to be chosen not because he was no good but because no one wanted dudley to think they liked him finchfletchley justin hufflepuff sometimes harry noticed the hat shouted out the house at once but at others it took a little while to decide finnigan seamus the sandyhaired boy next to harry in the line sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a gryffindor granger hermione hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head gryffindor shouted the hat ron groaned a horrible thought struck harry as horrible thoughts always do when youre very nervous what if he wasnt chosen at all what if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages until professor mcgonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and hed better get back on the train when neville longbottom the boy who kept losing his toad was called he fell over on his way to the stool the hat took a long time to decide with neville when it finally shouted gryffindor neville ran off still wearing it and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to macdougal morag malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed slytherin malfoy went to join his friends crabbe and goyle looking pleased with himself there werent many people left now moon nott parkinson then a pair of twin girls patil and patil then perks sallyanne and then at last  potter harry as harry stepped forward whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall potter did she say the harry potter the last thing harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat he waited hmm said a small voice in his ear difficult very difficult plenty of courage i see not a bad mind either theres talent a my goodness yes  and a nice thirst to prove yourself now thats interesting so where shall i put you harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought not slytherin not

youre sure  better be gryffindor harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall he took off the hat and walked shakily toward the gryffindor table he was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in slytherin he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet percy the prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously while the weasley twins yelled we got potter we got potter harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff hed seen earlier the ghost patted his arm giving harry the sudden horrible feeling hed just plunged it into a bucket of icecold water he could see the high table properly now at the end nearest him sat hagrid who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up harry grinned back and there in the center of the high table in a large gold chair sat albus dumbledore harry recognized him at once from the card hed gotten out of the chocolate frog on the train dumbledores silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts harry spotted professor quirtell too the nervous young man from the leaky cauldron he was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban and now there were only three people left to be sorted thomas dean a black boy even taller than ron joined harry at the gryffindor table turpin lisa became a ravenclaw and then it was rons turn he was pale green by now harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had shouted gryffindor harry clapped loudly with the rest as ron collapsed into the chair next to him well done ron excellent said percy weasley pompously across harry as zabini blaise was made a slytherin professor mcgonagall rolled up her scroll and took the sorting hat away harry looked down at his empty gold plate he had only just realized how hungry he was the pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago albus dumbledore had gotten to his feet he was beaming at the students his arms opened wide as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there welcome he said welcome to a new year at hogwarts before we begin our banquet i would like to say a few words and here they are nitwit blubber oddment tweak thank you he sat back down everybody clapped and cheered harry didnt know whether to laugh or not is he  a bit mad he asked percy uncertainly mad said percy airily hes a genius best wizard in the world but he is a bit mad yes potatoes harry harrys

neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge
