pe at the plant in a matter of seconds the two boys felt it loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth wriggling and flailing it unraveled itself from their bodies and they were able to pull free lucky you pay attention in herbology hermione said harry as he joined her by the wall wiping sweat off his face yeah said ron and lucky harry doesnt lose his head in a crisis  theres no wood honestly this way said harry pointing down a stone passageway which was the only way forward all they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of water trickling down the walls the passageway sloped downward and harry was reminded of gringotts with an unpleasant jolt of the heart he remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards bank if they met a dragon a fullygrown dragon  norbert had been bad enough can you hear something ron whispered harry listened a soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up ahead do you think its a ghost i dont know sounds like wings to me theres light ahead  i can see something moving they reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly lit chamber its ceiling arching high above them it was full of small jewelbright birds fluttering and tumbling all around the room on the opposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door do you think theyll attack us if we cross the room said ron probably said harry they dont look very vicious but i suppose if they all swooped down at once well theres no other choice ill run he took a deep breath covered his face with his arms and sprinted across the room he expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second but nothing happened he reached the door untouched he pulled the handle but it was locked the other two followed him they tugged and heaved at the door but it wouldnt budge not even when hermione tried her alohomora charm now what said ron these birds they cant be here just for decoration said hermione they watched the birds soaring overhead glittering  glittering theyre not birds harry said suddenly theyre keys winged keys  look carefully so that must mean he looked around the chamber while the other two squinted up at the flock of keys  yes  look broomsticks weve got to catch the key to the door but there are hundreds of them ron examined the lock on the door were looking for a big oldfashioned one  probably silver like the handle they each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys they grabbed and snatched but the bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one not for nothing though was harry the youngest seeker in a century he had a knack for spotting things other people didnt after a minutes weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers he noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing as if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the keyhole that one he called to the others that big one  there  no there  with bright blue wings  the feathers are all crumpled on one side ron went speeding in the direction that harry was pointing crashed into the ceiling and nearly fell off his broom weve got to close in on it harry called not taking his eyes off the key with the damaged wing ron you come at it from above  hermione stay below and stop it from going down and ill try and catch it right now ron dived hermione rocketed upward the key dodged them both and harry streaked after it it sped toward the wall harry leaned forward and with a nasty crunching noise pinned it against the stone with one hand ron and hermiones cheers echoed around the high chamber they landed quickly and harry ran to the door the key struggling in his hand he rammed it into the lock and turned  it worked the moment the lock had clicked open the key took flight again looking very battered now that it had been caught twice ready harry asked the other two his hand on the door handle they nodded he pulled the door open the next chamber was so dark they couldnt see anything at all but as they stepped into it light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight they were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard behind the black chessmen which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like black stone facing them way across the chamber were the white pieces harry ron and hermione shivered slightly  the towering white chessmen had no faces now what do we do harry whispered its obvious isnt it said ron weve got to play our way across the room behind the white pieces they could see another door how said hermione nervously i think said ron were going to have to be chessmen he walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knights horse at once the stone sprang to life the horse pawed the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at ron do we  er  have to join you to get across the black knight nodded ron turned to the other two this needs thinking about he said i suppose weve got to take the place of three of the black pieces harry and hermione stayed quiet watching ron think finally he said now dont be offended or anything but neither of you are that good at chess  were not offended said harry quickly just tell us what to do well harry you take the place of that bishop and hermione you 90 next to him instead of that castle what about you im going to be a knight said ron the chessmen seemed to have been listening because at these words a knight a bishop and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the board leaving three empty squares that harry ron and hermione took white always plays first in chess said ron peering across the board yes look a white pawn had moved forward two squares ron started to direct the black pieces they moved silently wherever he sent them harrys knees were trembling what if they lost harry  move diagonally four squares to the right their first real shock came when their other knight was taken the white queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board where he lay quite still facedown had to let that happen said ron looking shaken leaves you free to take that bishop hermione go on every time one of their men was lost the white pieces showed no mercy soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall twice ron only just noticed in time that harry and hermione were in danger he himself darted around the board taking almost as many white pieces as they had lost black ones were nearly there he muttered suddenly let me think let me think the white queen turned her blank face toward him yes said ron softly its the only way ive got to be taken nof harry and hermione shouted thats chess snapped ron youve got to make some sacrifices i take one step forward and shell take me  that leaves you free to checkmate the king harry but  do you want to stop snape or not ron  look if you dont hurry up hell already have the stone there was no alternative ready ron called his face pale but determined here i go  now dont hang around once youve won he stepped forward and the white queen pounced she struck ron hard across the head with her stone arm and he crashed to the floor  hermione screamed but stayed on her square  the white queen dragged ron to one side he looked as if hed been knocked out shaking harry moved three spaces to the left the white king took off his crown and threw it at harrys feet they had won the chessmen parted and bowed leaving the door ahead clear with one last desperate look back at ron harry and hermione charged through the door and up the next passageway what if hes  hell be all right said harry trying to convince himself what do you reckons next weve had sprouts that was the devils snare flitwick mustve put charms on the keys mcgonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive that leaves quirrells spell and snapes they had reached another door all right harry whispered go on harry pushed it open a disgusting smell filled their nostrils making both of them pull their robes up over their noses eyes watering they saw flat on the floor in front of them a troll even larger than the one they had tackled out cold with a bloody lump on its head im glad we didnt have to fight that one harry whispered as they stepped carefully over one of its massive legs come on i cant breathe he pulled open the next door both of them hardly daring to look at what came next  but there was nothing very frightening in here just a table with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line snapes said harry what do we have to do they stepped over the threshold and immediately a fire sprang up behind them in the doorway it wasnt ordinary fire either it was purple at the same instant black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward they were trapped look hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles harry looked over her shoulder to read it danger lies before you while safety lies behind two of us will help you which ever you would find one among us seven will let you move ahead another will transport the drinker back instead two among our number hold only nettle wine three of us are killers waiting bidden in line choose unless you wish to stay here forevermore to help you in your choice we give you these clues four first however slyly the poison tries to hide you will always find some on nettle wines left side second different are those who stand at either end but if you would move onward neither is your friend third as you see clearly all are different size neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides fourth the second left and the second on the right are twins once you taste them though different at first sight hermione let out a great sigh and harry amazed saw that she was smiling the very last thing he felt like doing brilliant said hermione this isnt magic  its logic  a puzzle a lot of the greatest wizards havent got an ounce of logic theyd be stuck in here forever but so will we wont we of course not said hermione everything we need is here on this paper seven bottles three are poison two are wine one will get us safely through the black fire and one will get us back through the purple but how do we know which to drink give me a minute hermione read the paper several times then she walked up and down the line of bottles muttering to herself and pointing at them at last she clapped her hands got it she said the smallest bottle will get us through the black fire  toward the stone harry looked at the tiny bottle theres only enough there for one of us he said thats hardly one swallow they looked at each other which one will get you back through the purple flames hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line you drink that said harry no listen get back and get ron grab brooms from the flying key room theyll get you out of the trapdoor and past fluffy  go straight to the owlery and send hedwig to dumbledore we need him i might be able to hold snape off for a while but im no match for him really but harry  what if youknowwhos with him well  i was lucky once wasnt i said harry pointing at his scar i might get lucky again hermiones lip trembled and she suddenly dashed at harry and threw her arms around him hermione harry  youre a great wizard you know im not as good as you said harry very embarrassed as she let go of him me said hermione books and cleverness there are more important things  friendship and bravery and  oh harry  be careful you drink first said harry you are sure which is which arent you positive said hermione she took a long drink from the round bottle at the end and shuddered its not poison said harry anxiously no  but its like ice quick go before it wears off good luck  take care go hermione turned and walked straight through the purple fire harry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle he turned to face the black flames here i come he said and he drained the little bottle in one gulp it was indeed as though ice was flooding his body he put the bottle down and walked forward he braced himself saw the black flames licking his body but couldnt feel them  for a moment he could see nothing but dark fire  then he was on the other side in the last chamber there was already someone there  but it wasnt snape it wasnt even voldemort chapter seventeen the man with two faces it was quirrell you gasped harry quirrell smiled his face wasnt twitching at all me he said calmly i wondered whether id be meeting you here potter but i thought  snape  severus quirrell laughed and it wasnt his usual quivering treble either but cold and sharp yes severus does seem the type doesnt he so useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat next to him who would suspect pppoor ststuttering pprofessor quirrell harry couldnt take it in this couldnt be true it couldnt but snape tried to kill me no no no i tried to kill you your friend miss granger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed to set fire to snape at that quidditch match she broke my eye contact with you another few seconds and id have got you off that broom id have managed it before then if snape hadnt been muttering a countercurse trying to save you snape was trying to save me of course said quirrell coolly why do you think he wanted to referee your next match he was trying to make sure i didnt do it again funny really he neednt have bothered i couldnt do anything with dumbledore watching all the other teachers thought snape was trying to stop gryffindor from winning he did make himself unpopular and what a waste of time when after all that im going to kill you tonight quirrell snapped his fingers ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped themselves tightly around harry youre too nosy to live potter scurrying around the school on halloween like that for all i knew youd seen me coming to look at what was guarding the stone you let the troll in certainly i have a special gift with trolls  you must have seen what i did to the one in the chamber back there unfortunately while everyone else was running around looking for it snape who already suspected me went straight to the third floor to head me off  and not only did my troll fail to beat you to death that threeheaded dog didnt even manage to bite snapes leg off properly now wait quietly potter i need to examine this interesting mirror it was only then that harry realized what was standing behind quirrell it was the mirror of erised this mirror is the key to finding the stone quirrell murmured tapping his way around the frame trust dumbledore to come up with something like this but hes in london ill be far away by the time he gets back all harry could think of doing was to keep quirrell talking and stop him from concentrating on the mirror i saw you and snape in the forest  he blurted out yes said quirrell idly walking around the mirror to look at the back he was on to me by that time trying to find out how far id got he suspected me all along tried to frighten me  as though he could when i had lord voldemort on my side quirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into it i see the stone im presenting it to my master but where is it harry struggled against the ropes binding him but they didnt give he had to keep quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror but snape always seemed to hate me so much oh he does said quirrell casually heavens yes he was at hogwarts with your father didnt you know they loathed each other but he never wanted you dead but i heard you a few days ago sobbing  i thought snape was threatening you for the first time a spasm of fear flitted across quirrells face sometimes he said i find it hard to follow my masters instructions  he is a great wizard and i am weak  you mean he was there in the classroom with you harry gasped he is with me wherever i go said quirrell quietly i met him when i traveled around the world a foolish young man i was then full of ridiculous ideas about good and evil lord voldemort showed me how wrong i was there is no good and evil there is only power and those too weak to seek it since then i have served him faithfully although i have let him down many times he has had to be very hard on me quirrell shivered suddenly he does not forgive mistakes easily when i failed to steal the stone from gringotts he was most displeased he punished me decided he would have to keep a closer watch on me quirrells voice trailed away harry was remembering his trip to diagon alley how could he have been so stupid hed seen quirrell there that very day shaken hands with him in the leaky cauldron quirrell cursed under his breath i dont understand is the stone inside the mirror should i break it harrys mind was racing what i want more than anything else in the world at the moment he thought is to find the stone before quirrell does so if i look in the mirror i should see myseff finding it  which means ill see where its hidden but how can i look without quirrell realizing what im up to he tried to edge to the left to get in front of the glass without quirrell noticing but the ropes around his ankles were too tight he tripped and fell over quirrell ignored him he was still talking to himself what does this mirror do how does it work help me master and to harrys horror a voice answered and the voice seemed to come from quirrell himself use the boy use the boy quirrell rounded on harry yes  potter  come here he clapped his hands once and the ropes binding harry fell off harry got slowly to his feet come here quirrell repeated look in the mirror and tell me what you see harry walked toward him i must lie he thought desperately i must look and lie about what i see thats all quirrell moved close behind him harry breathed in the funny smell that seemed to come from quirrells turban he closed his eyes stepped in front of the mirror and opened them again he saw his reflection pale and scaredlooking at first but a moment later the reflection smiled at him it put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a bloodred stone it winked and put the stone back in its pocket  and as it did so harry felt something heavy drop into his real pocket somehow  incredibly  hed gotten the stone well said quirrell impatiently what do you see harry screwed up his courage i see myself shaking hands with dumbledore he invented i  ive won the house cup for gryffindor quirrell cursed again get out of the way he said as harry moved aside he felt the sorcerers stone against his leg dare he make a break for it but he hadnt walked five paces before a high voice spoke though quirrell wasnt moving his lips he lies he lies potter come back here quirrell shouted tell me the truth what did you just see the high voice spoke again let me speak to him facetoface master you are not strong enough i have strength enough for this harry felt as if devils snare was rooting him to the spot he couldnt move a muscle petrified he watched as quirrell reached up and began to unwrap his turban what was going on the turban fell away quirrells head looked strangely small without it then he turned slowly on the spot harry would have screamed but he couldnt make a sound where there should have been a back to quirrells head there was a face the most terrible face harry had ever seen it was chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils like a snake harry potter it whispered harry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldnt move see what i have become the face said mere shadow and vapor  i have form only when i can share anothers body but there have always been those willing to let me into their hearts and minds unicorn blood has strengthened me these past weeks you saw faithful quirrell drinking it for me in the forest and once i have the elixir of life i will be able to create a body of my own now why dont you give me that stone in your pocket so he knew the feeling suddenly surged back into harrys legs he stumbled backward dont be a fool snarled the face better save your own life and join me or youll meet the same end as your parents they died begging me for mercy liar harry shouted suddenly quirrell was walking backward at him so that voldemort could still see him the evil face was now smiling how touching it hissed i always value bravery yes boy your parents were brave i killed your father first and he put up a courageous fight but your mother neednt have died she was trying to protect you now give me the stone unless you want her to have died in vain never harry sprang toward the flame door but voldemort screamed seize him and the next second harry felt quirrells hand close on his wrist at once a needlesharp pain seared across harrys scar his head felt as though it was about to split in two he yelled struggling with all his might and to his surprise quirrell let go of him the pain in his head lessened  he looked around wildly to see where quirrell had gone and saw him hunched in pain looking at his fingers  they were blistering before his eyes seize him seize him shrieked voldemort again and quirrell lunged knocking harry clean off his feet landing on top of him both hands around harrys neck  harrys scar was almost blinding him with pain yet he could see quirrell howling in agony master i cannot hold him  my hands  my hands and quirrell though pinning harry to the ground with his knees let go of his neck and stared bewildered at his own palms  harry could see they looked burned raw red and shiny then kill him fool and be done screeched voldemort quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse but harry by instinct reached up and grabbed quirrells face  aaaargh quirrell rolled off him his face blistering too and then harry knew quirrell couldnt touch his bare skin not without suffering terrible pain  his only chance was to keep hold of quirrell keep him in enough pain to stop him from doing a curse harry jumped to his feet caught quirrell by the arm and hung on as tight as he could quirrell screamed and tried to throw harry off  the pain in harrys head was building  he couldnt see  he could only hear quirrells terrible shrieks and voldemorts yells of kill him kill him and other voices maybe in harrys own head crying harry harry he felt quirrells arm wrenched from his grasp knew all was lost and fell into blackness down  down down something gold was glinting just above him the snitch he tried to catch it but his arms were too heavy he blinked it wasnt the snitch at all it was a pair of glasses how strange he blinked again the smiling face of albus dumbledore swam into view above him good afternoon harry said dumbledore harry stared at him then he remembered sir the stone it was quirrell hes got the stone sir quick  calm yourself dear boy you are a little behind the times said dumbledore quirrell does not have the stone then who does sir i  harry please relax or madam pomfrey will have me thrown out harry swallowed and looked around him he realized he must be in the hospital wing he was lying in a bed with white linen sheets and next to him was a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop tokens from your friends and admirers said dumbledore beaming what happened down in the dungeons between you and professor quirrell is a complete secret so naturally the whole school knows i believe your friends misters fred and george weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat no doubt they thought it would amuse you madam pomfrey however felt it might not be very hygienic and confiscated it how long have i been in here three days mr ronald weasley and miss granger will be most relieved you have come round they have been extremely worried but sit the stone i see you are not to be distracted very well the stone professor quirrell did not manage to take it from you i arrived in time to prevent that although you were doing very well on your own i must say you got there you got hermiones owl we must have crossed in midair no sooner had i reached london than it became clear to me that the place i should be was the one i had just left i arrived just in time to pull quirrell off you it was you i feared i might be too late you nearly were i couldnt have kept him off the stone much longer  not the stone boy you  the effort involved nearly killed you for one terrible moment there i was afraid it had as for the stone it has been destroyed destroyed said harry blankly but your friend  nicolas flamel  oh you know about nicolas said dumbledore sounding quite delighted you did do the thing properly didnt you well nicolas and i have had a little chat and agreed its all for the best but that means he and his wife will die wont they they have enough elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then yes they will die dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on harrys face to one as young as you im sure it seems incredible but to nicolas and perenelle it really is like going to bed after a very very long day after all to the wellorganized mind death is but the next great adventure you know the stone was really not such a wonderful thing as much money and life as you could want the two things most human beings would choose above all  the trouble is humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them harry lay there lost for words dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at the ceiling sir said harry ive been thinking sir  even if the stones gone vol i mean youknow who  call him voldemort harry always use the proper name for things fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself yes sir well voldemorts going to try other ways of coming back isnt he i mean he hasnt gone has he no harry he has not he is still out there somewhere perhaps looking for another body to share not being truly alive he cannot be killed he left quirrell to die he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies nevertheless harry while you may only have delayed his return to power it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next time  and if he is delayed again and again why he may never return to power harry nodded but stopped quickly because it made his head hurt then he said sir there are some other things id like to know if you can tell me things i want to know the truth about the truth dumbledore sighed it is a beautiful and terrible thing and should therefore be treated with great caution however i shall answer your questions unless i have a very good reason not to in which case i beg youll forgive me i shall not of course lie well voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried to stop him from killing me but why would he want to kill me in the first place dumbledore sighed very deeply this time alas the first thing you ask me i cannot tell you not today not now you will know one day put it from your mind for now harry when you are older i know you hate to hear this when you are ready you will know and harry knew it would be no good to argue but why couldnt quirrell touch me your mother died to save you if there is one thing voldemort cannot understand it is love he didnt realize that love as powerful as your mothers for you leaves its own mark not a scar no visible sign to have been loved so deeply even though the person who loved us is gone will give us some protection forever it is in your very skin quirrell full of hatred greed and ambition sharing his soul with voldemort could not touch you for this reason it was agony to touch a person marked by something so good dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill which gave harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet when he had found his voice again harry said and the invisibility cloak  do you know who sent it to me ah  your father happened to leave it in my possession and i thought you might like it dumbledores eyes twinkled useful things your father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when he was here and theres something else fire away quirrell said snape  professor snape harry yes him  quirrell said he hates me because he hated my father is that true well they did rather detest each other not unlike yourself and mr malfoy and then your father did something snape could never forgive what he saved his life what yes said dumbledore dreamily funny the way peoples minds work isnt it professor snape couldnt bear being in your fathers debt i do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt that would make him and your father even then he could go back to hating your fathers memory in peace harry tried to understand this but it made his head pound so he stopped and sir theres one more thing just the one how did i get the stone out of the mirror ah now im glad you asked me that it was one of my more brilliant ideas and between you and me thats saying something you see only one who wanted to find the stone  find it but not use it  would be able to get it otherwise theyd just see themselves making gold or drinking elixir of life my brain surprises even me sometimes now enough questions i suggest you make a start on these sweets ah bettie botts every flavor beans i was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomitflavored one and since then im afraid ive rather lost my liking for them  but i think ill be safe with a nice toffee dont you he smiled and popped the goldenbrown bean into his mouth then he choked and said alas ear wax madam pomfrey the nurse was a nice woman but very strict just five minutes harry pleaded absolutely not you let professor dumbledore in well of course that was the headmaster quite different you need rest i am resting look lying down and everything oh go on madam pomfrey oh very well she said but five minutes only and she let ron and hermione in harry hermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again but harry was glad she held herself in as his head was still very sore oh harry we were sure you were going to  dumbledore was so worried  the whole schools talking about it said ron what really happened it was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more strange and exciting than the wild rumors harry told them everything quirrell the mirror the stone and voldemort ron and hermione were a very good audience they gasped in all the right places and when harry told them what was under quirrells turban hermione screamed out loud so the stones gone said ron finally flamels just going to die thats what i said but dumbledore thinks that  what was it  to the wellorganized mind death is but the next great adventure i always said he was off his rocker said ron looking quite impressed at how crazy his hero was so what happened to you two said harry well i got back all right said hermione i brought ron round  that took a while  and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact dumbledore when we met him in the entrance hall  he already knew  he just said harrys gone after him hasnt he and hurtled off to the third floor dyou think he meant you to do it said ron sending you your fathers cloak and everything well  hermione exploded if he did  i mean to say thats terrible  you could have been killed no it isnt said harry thoughtfully hes a funny man dumbledore i think he sort of wanted to give me a chance i think he knows more or less everything that goes on here you know i reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try and instead of stopping us he just taught us enough to help i dont think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked its almost like he thought i had the right to face voldemort if i could yeah dumbledores off his rocker all right said ron proudly listen youve got to be up for the endofyear feast tomorrow the points are all in and slytherin won of course  you missed the last quidditch match we were steamrollered by ravenclaw without you  but the foodll be good at that moment madam pomfrey bustled over youve had nearly fifteen minutes now out she said firmly after a good nights sleep harry felt nearly back to normal i want to go to the feast he told madam pomfrey as she straightened his many candy boxes i can cant i professor dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go she said stiffily as though in her opinion professor dumbledore didnt realize how risky feasts could be and you have another visitor oh good said harry who is it hagrid sidled through the door as he spoke as usual when he was indoors hagrid looked too big to be allowed he sat down next to harry took one look at him and burst into tears its  all  my  ruddy  fault he sobbed his face in his hands i told the evil git how ter get past fluffy i told him it was the only thing he didnt know an i told him yeh couldve died all fer a dragon egg ill never drink again i should be chucked out an made ter live as a muggle hagrid said harry shocked to see hagrid shaking with grief and remorse great tears leaking down into his beard hagrid hed have found out somehow this is voldemort were talking about hed have found out even if you hadnt told him yeh couldve died sobbed hagrid an don say the name voldemort harry bellowed and hagrid was so shocked he stopped crying ive met him and im calling him by his name please cheer up hagrid we saved the stone its gone he cant use it have a chocolate frog ive got loads hagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and said that reminds me ive got yeh a present its not a stoat sandwich is it said harry anxiously and at last hagrid gave a weak chuckle nah dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter fix it course he shoulda sacked me instead  anyway got yeh this it seemed to be a handsome leathercovered book harry opened it curiously it was full of wizard photographs smiling and waving at him from every page were his mother and father sent owls off ter all yer parents old school friends askin fer photos knew yeh didn have any dyeh like it harry couldnt speak but hagrid understood harry made his way down to the endofyear feast alone that night he had been held up by madam pomfreys fussing about insisting on giving him one last checkup so the great hall was already full it was decked out in the slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate slytherins winning the house cup for the seventh year in a row a huge banner showing the slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the high table when harry walked in there was a sudden hush and then everybody started talking loudly at once he slipped into a seat between ron and hermione at the gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were standing up to look at him fortunately dumbledore arrived moments later the babble died away another year gone dumbledore said cheerfully and i must trouble you with an old mans wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious feast what a year it has been hopefully your heads are all a little fuller than they were you have the whole summer ahead to get them nice and empty before next year starts now as i understand it the house cup here needs awarding and the points stand thus in fourth place gryffindor with three hundred and twelve points in third hufflepuff with three hundred and fiftytwo ravenclaw has four hundred and twentysix and slytherin four hundred and seventy two a storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the slytherin table harry could see draco malfoy banging his goblet on the table it was a sickening sight yes yes well done slytherin said dumbledore however recent events must be taken into account the room went very still the slytherins smiles faded a little ahem said dumbledore i have a few lastminute points to dish out let me see yes first  to mr ronald weasley ron went purple in the face he looked like a radish with a bad sunburn for the bestplayed game of chess hogwarts has seen in many years i award gryffindor house fifty points gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling the stars overhead seemed to quiver percy could be heard telling the other prefects my brother you know my youngest brother got past mcgonagalls giant chess set at last there was silence again second  to miss hermione granger for the use of cool logic in the face of fire i award gryffindor house fifty points hermione buried her face in her arms harry strongly suspected she had burst into tears gryffindors up and down the table were beside themselves  they were a hundred points up third  to mr harry potter said dumbledore the room went deadly quiet for pure nerve and outstanding courage i award gryffindor house sixty points the din was deafening those who could add up while yelling themselves hoarse knew that gryffindor now had four hundred and seventytwo points  exactly the same as slytherin they had tied for the house cup  if only dumbledore had given harry just one more point dumbledore raised his hand the room gradually fell silent there are all kinds of courage said dumbledore smiling it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies but just as much to stand up to our friends i therefore award ten points to mr neville longbottom someone standing outside the great hall might well have thought some sort of explosion had taken place so loud was the noise that erupted from the gryffindor table harry ron and hermione stood up to yell and cheer as neville white with shock disappeared under a pile of people hugging him he had never won so much as a point for gryffindor before harry still cheering nudged ron in the ribs and pointed at malfoy who couldnt have looked more stunned and horrified if hed just had the bodybind curse put on him which means dumbledore called over the storm of applause for even ravenclaw and hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of slytherin we need a little change of decoration he clapped his hands in an instant the green hangings became scarlet and the silver became gold the huge
