someone had obviously tried to behead him but not done it properly looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces nearly headless nick flipped his head back onto his neck coughed and said so  new gryffindors i hope youre going to help us win the house championship this year gryffindors have never gone so long without winning slytherins have got the cup six years in a row the bloody barons becoming almost unbearable  hes the slytherin ghost harry looked over at the slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there with blank staring eyes a gaunt face and robes stained with silver blood he was right next to malfoy who harry was pleased to see didnt look too pleased with the seating arrangements how did he get covered in blood asked seamus with great interest ive never asked said nearly headless nick delicately when everyone had eaten as much as they could the remains of the food faded from the plates leaving them sparkling clean as before a moment later the desserts appeared blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of apple pies treacle tarts chocolate eclairs and jam doughnuts trifle strawberries jello rice pudding   as harry helped himself to a treacle tart the talk turned to their families im halfandhalf said seamus me dads a muggle mom didnt tell him she was a witch til after they were married bit of a nasty shock for him the others laughed what about you neville said ron well my gran brought me up and shes a witch said neville but the family thought i was all muggle for ages my great uncle algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me  he pushed me off the end of blackpool pier once i nearly drowned  but nothing happened until i was eight great uncle algie came round for dinner and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my great auntie enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go but i bounced  all the way down the garden and into the road they were all really pleased gran was crying she was so happy and you should have seen their faces when i got in here  they thought i might not be magic enough to come you see great uncle algie was so pleased he bought me my toad on harrys other side percy weasley and hermione were talking about lessons i do hope they start right away theres so much to learn im particularly interested in transfiguration you know turning something into something else of course its supposed to be very difficult youll be starting small just matches into needles and that sort of thing   harry who was starting to feel warm and sleepy looked up at the high table again hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet professor mcgonagall was talking to professor dumbledore professor quirrell in his absurd turban was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair a hooked nose and sallow skin it happened very suddenly the hooknosed teacher looked past quirrells turban straight into harrys eyes  and a sharp hot pain shot across the scar on harrys forehead ouch harry clapped a hand to his head what is it asked percy nnothing the pain had gone as quickly as it had come harder to shake off was the feeling harry had gotten from the teachers look  a feeling that he didnt like harry at all whos that teacher talking to professor quirrell he asked percy oh you know quirrell already do you no wonder hes looking so nervous thats professor snape he teaches potions but he doesnt want to  everyone knows hes after quirrells job knows an awful lot about the dark arts snape harry watched snape for a while but snape didnt look at him again at last the desserts too disappeared and professor dumbledore got to his feet again the hall fell silent ahern  just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered i have a few startofterm notices to give you first years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils and a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well dumbledores twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the weasley twins i have also been asked by mr filch the caretaker to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact madam hooch and finally i must tell you that this year the thirdfloor corridor on the righthand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death harry laughed but he was one of the few who did hes not serious he muttered to percy must be said percy frowning at dumbledore its odd because he usually gives us a reason why were not allowed to go somewhere  the forests full of dangerous beasts everyone knows that i do think he might have told us prefects at least and now before we go to bed let us sing the school song cried dumbledore harry noticed that the other teachers smiles had become rather fixed dumbledore gave his wand a little flick as if he was trying to get a fly off the end and a long golden ribbon flew out of it which rose high above the tables and twisted itself snakelike into words everyone pick their favorite tune said dumbledore and off we go and the school bellowed hogwarts hogwarts hoggy warty hogwarts teach us something please whether we be old and bald or young with scabby knees our heads could do with filling with some interesting stuff for now theyre bare and full of air dead flies and bits of fluff so teach us things worth knowing bring back what weve forgot just do your best well do the rest and learn until our brains all rot everybody finished the song at different times at last only the weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they had finished he was one of those who clapped loudest ah music he said wiping his eyes a magic beyond all we do here and now bedtime off you trot the gryffindor first years followed percy through the chattering crowds out of the great hall and up the marble staircase harrys legs were like lead again but only because he was so tired and full of food he was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed or that twice percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries they climbed more staircases yawning and dragging their feet and harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden halt a bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them and as percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him peeves percy whispered to the first years a poltergeist he raised his voice peeves  show yourself a loud rude sound like the air being let out of a balloon answered do you want me to go to the bloody baron there was a pop and a little man with wicked dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared floating cross legged in the air clutching the walking sticks oooooooh he said with an evil cackle ickle firsties what fun he swooped suddenly at them they all ducked go away peeves or the baronll hear about this i mean it barked percy peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished dropping the walking sticks on nevilles head they heard him zooming away rattling coats of armor as he passed you want to watch out for peeves said percy as they set off again the bloody barons the only one who can control him he wont even listen to us prefects here we are at the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress password she said caput draconis said percy and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall they all scrambled through it  neville needed a leg up  and found themselves in the gryffindor common room a cozy round room full of squashy armchairs percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another at the top of a spiral staircase  they were obviously in one of the towers  they found their beds at last five fourposters hung with deep red velvet curtains their trunks had already been brought up too tired to talk much they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed  great food isnt it ron muttered to harry through the hangings get off scabbers hes chewing my sheets harry was going to ask ron if hed had any of the treacle tart but he fell asleep almost at once perhaps harry had eaten a bit too much because he had a very strange dream he was wearing professor quirrells turban which kept talking to him telling him he must transfer to slytherin at once because it was his destiny harry told the turban he didnt want to be in slytherin it got heavier and heavier he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully  and there was malfoy laughing at him as he struggled with it then malfoy turned into the hooknosed teacher snape whose laugh became high and cold  there was a burst of green light and harry woke sweating and shaking he rolled over and fell asleep again and when he woke next day he didnt remember the dream at all chapter eight the potions master there look where next to the tall kid with the red hair wearing the glasses did you see his face did you see his scar whispers followed harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next day people lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again staring harry wished they wouldnt because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes there were a hundred and fortytwo staircases at hogwarts wide sweeping ones narrow rickety ones some that led somewhere different on a friday some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump then there were doors that wouldnt open unless you asked politely or tickled them in exactly the right place and doors that werent really doors at all but solid walls just pretending it was also very hard to remember where anything was because it all seemed to move around a lot the people in the portraits kept going to visit each other and harry was sure the coats of armor could walk the ghosts didnt help either it was always a nasty shock when one of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open nearly headless nick was always happy to point new gryffindors in the right direction but peeves the poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him when you were late for class he would drop wastepaper baskets on your head pull rugs from under your feet pelt you with bits of chalk or sneak up behind you invisible grab your nose and screech got your conk even worse than peeves if that was possible was the caretaker argus filch harry and ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning filch found them trying to force their way through a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the outofbounds corridor on the third floor he wouldnt believe they were lost was sure they were trying to break into it on purpose and was threatening to lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by professor quirrell who was passing filch owned a cat called mrs norris a scrawny dustcolored creature with bulging lamp like eyes just like filchs she patrolled the corridors alone break a rule in front of her put just one toe out of line and shed whisk off for filch whod appear wheezing two seconds later filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than anyone except perhaps the weasley twins and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghosts the students all hated him and it was the dearest ambition of many to give mrs norris a good kick and then once you had managed to find them there were the classes themselves there was a lot more to magic as harry quickly found out than waving your wand and saying a few funny words they had to study the night skies through their telescopes every wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movements of the planets three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study herbology with a dumpy little witch called professor sprout where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi and found out what they were used for easily the most boring class was history of magic which was the only one taught by a ghost professor binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to teach leaving his body behind him binns droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates and got emetic the evil and uric the oddball mixed up professor flitwick the charms teacher was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk at the start of their first class he took the roll call and when he reached harrys name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight professor mcgonagall was again different harry had been quite right to think she wasnt a teacher to cross strict and clever she gave them a talkingto the moment they sat down in her first class transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at hogwarts she said anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back you have been warned then she changed her desk into a pig and back again they were all very impressed and couldnt wait to get started but soon realized they werent going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time after taking a lot of complicated notes they were each given a match and started trying to turn it into a needle by the end of the lesson only hermione granger had made any difference to her match professor mcgonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave hermione a rare smile the class everyone had really been looking forward to was defense against the dark arts but quirrells lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke his classroom smelled strongly of garlic which everyone said was to ward off a vampire hed met in romania and was afraid would be coming back to get him one of these days his turban he told them had been given to him by an african prince as a thankyou for getting rid of a troublesome zombie but they werent sure they believed this story for one thing when seamus finnigan asked eagerly to hear how quirrell had fought off the zombie quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather for another they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban and the weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of garlic as well so that quirrell was protected wherever he went harry was very relieved to find out that he wasnt miles behind everyone else lots of people had come from muggle families and like him hadnt had any idea that they were witches and wizards there was so much to learn that even people like ron didnt have much of a head start friday was an important day for harry and ron they finally managed to find their way down to the great hall for breakfast without getting lost once what have we got today harry asked ron as he poured sugar on his porridge double potions with the slytherins said ron snapes head of slytherin house they say he always favors them  well be able to see if its true wish mcgonagall favored us  said harry professor mcgonagall was head of gryffindor house but it hadnt stopped her from giving them a huge pile of homework the day before just then the mail arrived harry had gotten used to this by now but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the great hall during breakfast circling the tables until they saw their owners and dropping letters and packages onto their laps hedwig hadnt brought harry anything so far she sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls this morning however she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto harrys plate harry tore it open at once it said in a very untidy scrawl dear harry i know you get friday afternoons off so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three i want to hear all about your first week send us an answer back with hedwig hagrid harry borrowed rons quill scribbled yes please see you later on the back of the note and sent hedwig off again it was lucky that harry had tea with hagrid to look forward to because the potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so far at the startofterm banquet harry had gotten the idea that professor snape disliked him by the end of the first potions lesson he knew hed been wrong snape didnt dislike harry  he hated him potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons it was colder here than up in the main castle and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls snape like flitwick started the class by taking the roll call and like flitwick he paused at harrys name ah yes he said softly harry potter our new  celebrity draco malfoy and his friends crabbe and goyle sniggered behind their hands snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class his eyes were black like hagrids but they had none of hagrids warmth they were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels you are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potionmaking he began he spoke in barely more than a whisper but they caught every word  like professor mcgonagall snape had y caught every word  like professor mcgonagall snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort as there is little foolish wandwaving here many of you will hardly believe this is magic i dont expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins bewitching the mind ensnaring the senses i can teach you how to bottle fame brew glory even stopper death  if you arent as big a bunch of dunderheads as i usually have to teach more silence followed this little speech harry and ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows hermione granger was on the edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she wasnt a dunderhead potter said snape suddenly what would i get if i added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood powdered root of what to an infusion of what harry glanced at ron who looked as stumped as he was hermiones hand had shot into the air i dont know sit said harry snapes lips curled into a sneer tut tut  fame clearly isnt everything he ignored hermiones hand lets try again potter where would you look if i told you to find me a bezoar hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat but harry didnt have the faintest idea what a bezoar was he tried not to look at malfoy crabbe and goyle who were shaking with laughter i dont know sit thought you wouldnt open a book before coming eh potter harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes he had looked through his books at the dursleys but did snape expect him to remember everything in one thousand magical herbs and fungi snape was still ignoring hermiones quivering hand what is the difference potter between monkshood and wolfsbane at this hermione stood up her hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling i dont know said harry quietly i think hermione does though why dont you try her a few people laughed harry caught seamuss eye and seamus winked snape however was not pleased sit down he snapped at hermione for your information potter asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the draught of living death a bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons as for monkshood and wolfsbane they are the same plant which also goes by the name of aconite well why arent you all copying that down there was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment over the noise snape said and a point will be taken from gryffindor house for your cheek potter things didnt improve for the gryffindors as the potions lesson continued snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils he swept around in his long black cloak watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs criticizing almost everyone except malfoy whom he seemed to like he was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon neville had somehow managed to melt seamuss cauldron into a twisted blob and their potion was seeping across the stone floor burning holes in peoples shoes within seconds the whole class was standing on their stools while neville who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs idiot boy snarled snape clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand i suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose take him up to the hospital wing snape spat at seamus then he rounded on harry and ron who had been working next to neville you  potter  why didnt you tell him not to add the quills thought hed make you look good if he got it wrong did you thats another point youve lost for gryffindor this was so unfair that harry opened his mouth to argue but ron kicked him behind their cauldron doi push it he muttered ive heard snape can turn very nasty as they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later harrys mind was racing and his spirits were low hed lost two points for gryffindor in his very first week  why did snape hate him so much cheer up said ron snapes always taking points off fred and george can i come and meet hagrid with you at five to three they left the castle and made their way across the grounds hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest a crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door when harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks then hagrids voice rang out saying back fang  back hagrids big hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door open hang on he said back fang he let them in struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound there was only one room inside hams and pheasants were hanging from the ceiling a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire and in the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it make yerselves at home said hagrid letting go of fang who bounded straight at ron and started licking his ears like hagrid fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked this is ron harry told hagrid who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate another weasley eh said hagrid glancing at rons freckles i spent half me life chasin yer twin brothers away from the forest the rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their teeth but harry and ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told hagrid all about their first lessons fang rested his head on harrys knee and drooled all over his robes harry and ron were delighted to hear hagrid call fitch that old git an as fer that cat mrs norris id like ter introduce her to fang sometime dyeh know every time i go up ter the school she follows me everywhere cant get rid of her  fitch puts her up to it harry told hagrid about snapes lesson hagrid like ron told harry not to worry about it that snape liked hardly any of the students but he seemed to really hate me rubbish said hagrid why should he yet harry couldnt help thinking that hagrid didnt quite meet his eyes when he said that hows yer brother charlie hagrid asked ron i liked him a lot  great with animals harry wondered if hagrid had changed the subject on purpose while ron told hagrid all about charlies work with dragons harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy it was a cutting from the daily prophet gringotts breakin latest investigations continue into the breakin at gringotts on 31 july widely believed to be the work of dark wizards or witches unknown gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken the vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day but were not telling you what was in there so keep your noses out if you know whats good for you said a gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon harry remembered ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob gringotts but ron hadnt mentioned the date hagrid said harry that gringotts breakin happened on my birthday it mightve been happening while we were there there was no doubt about it hagrid definitely didnt meet harrys eyes this time he grunted and offered him another rock cake harry read the story again the vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen if you could call it emptying taking out that grubby little package had that been what the thieves were looking for as harry and ron walked back to the castle for dinner their pockets weighed down with rock cakes theyd been too polite to refuse harry thought that none of the lessons hed had so far had given him as much to think about as tea with hagrid had hagrid collected that package just in time where was it now and did hagrid know something about snape that he didnt want to tell harry chapter nine the midnight duel harry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than dudley but that was before he met draco malfoy still firstyear gryffindors only had potions with the slytherins so they didnt have to put up with malfoy much or at least they didnt until they spotted a notice pinned up in the gryffindor common room that made them all groan flying lessons would be starting on thursday  and gryffindor and slytherin would be learning together typical said harry darkly just what i always wanted to make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of malfoy he had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else you dont know that youll make a fool of yourself said ron reasonably anyway i know malfoys always going on about how good he is at quidditch but i bet thats all talk malfay certainly did talk about flying a lot he complained loudly about first years never getting on the house quidditch teams and told long boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping muggles in helicopters he wasnt the only one though the way seamus finnigan told it hed spent most of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his broomstick even ron would tell anyone whod listen about the time hed almost hit a hang glider on charlies old broom everyone from wizarding families talked about quidditch constantly ron had already had a big argument with dean thomas who shared their dormitory about soccer ron couldnt see what was exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly harry had caught ron prodding deans poster of west ham soccer team trying to make the players move neville had never been on a broomstick in his life because his grandmother had never let him near one privately harry felt shed had good reason because neville managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground hermione granger was almost as nervous about flying as neville was this was something you couldnt learn by heart out of a book  not that she hadnt tried at breakfast on thursday she bored them all stupid with flying tips shed gotten out of a library book called quidditch through the ages neville was hanging on to her every word desperate for anything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later but everybody else was very pleased when hermiones lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail harry hadnt had a single letter since hagrids note something that malfoy had been quick to notice of course malfoys eagle owl was always bringing him packages of sweets from home which he opened gloatingly at the slytherin table a barn owl brought neville a small package from his grandmother he opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble which seemed to be full of white smoke its a remembrall he explained gran knows i forget things  this tells you if theres something youve forgotten to do look you hold it tight like this and if it turns red  oh his face fell because the remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet youve forgotten something neville was trying to remember what hed forgotten when draco malfoy who was passing the gryffindor table snatched the remembrall out of his hand harry and ron jumped to their feet they were half hoping for a reason to fight malfay but professor mcgonagall who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school was there in a flash whats going on malfoys got my remembrall professor scowling malfoy quickly dropped the remembrall back on the table just looking he said and he sloped away with crabbe and goyle behind him at threethirty that afternoon harry ron and the other gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson it was a clear breezy day and the grass rippled under their feet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance the slytherins were already there and so were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground harry had heard fred and george weasley complain about the school brooms saying that some of them started to vibrate if you flew too high or always flew slightly to the left their teacher madam hooch arrived she had short gray hair and yellow eyes like a hawk well what are you all waiting for she barked everyone stand by a broomstick come on hurry up harry glanced down at his broom it was old and some of the twigs stuck out at odd angles stick out your right hand over your broom called madam hooch at the front and say up upf everyone shouted harrys broom jumped into his hand at once but it was one of the few that did hermione grangers had simply rolled over on the ground and nevilles hadnt moved at all perhaps brooms like horses could tell when you were afraid thought harry there was a quaver in nevilles voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the ground madam hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding off the end and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips harry and ron were delighted when she told malfoy hed been doing it wrong for years now when i blow my whistle you kick off from the ground hard said madam hooch keep your brooms steady rise a few feet and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly on my whistle  three  two  but neville nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the ground pushed off hard before the whistle had touched madam hoochs lips come back boy she shouted but neville was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle  twelve feet  twenty feet harry saw his scared white face look down at the ground falling away saw him gasp slip sideways off the broom and  wham  a thud and a nasty crack and neville lay facedown on the grass in a heap his broomstick was still rising higher and higher and started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight madam hooch was bending over neville her face as white as his broken wrist harry heard her mutter come on boy  its all right up you get she turned to the rest of the class none of you is to move while i take this boy to the hospital wing you leave those brooms where they are or youll be out of hogwarts before you can say quidditch come on dear neville his face tearstreaked clutching his wrist hobbled off with madam hooch who had her arm around him no sooner were they out of earshot than malfoy burst into laughter did you see his face the great lump the other slytherins joined in shut up malfoy snapped parvati patil ooh sticking up for longbottom said pansy parkinson a hardfaced slytherin girl never thought youd like fat little crybabies parvati look said malfoy darting forward and snatching something out of the grass its that stupid thing longbottoms gran sent him the remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up give that here malfoy said harry quietly everyone stopped talking to watch malfoy smiled nastily i think ill leave it somewhere for longbottom to find  how about  up a tree give it here harry yelled but malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick and taken off he hadnt been lying he could fly well hovering level with the topmost branches of an oak he called come and get it potter harry grabbed his broom no shouted hermione granger madam hooch told us not to move  youll get us all into trouble harry ignored her blood was pounding in his ears he mounted the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up up he soared air rushed through his hair and his robes whipped out behind him and in a rush of fierce joy he realized hed found something he could do without being taught  this was easy this was wonderful he pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even higher and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from ron he turned his broomstick sharply to face malfoy in midair malfoy looked stunned give it here harry called or ill knock you off that broom oh yeah said malfoy trying to sneer but looking worried harry knew somehow what to do he leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands and it shot toward malfay like a javelin malfoy only just got out of the way in time harry made a sharp aboutface and held the broom steady a few people below were clapping no crabbe and goyle up here to save your neck malfoy harry called the same thought seemed to have struck malfoy catch it if you can then he shouted and he threw the glass ball high into the air and streaked back toward the ground harry saw as though in slow motion the ball rise up in the air and then start to fall he leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down  next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive racing the ball  wind whistled in his ears mingled with the screams of people watching  he stretched out his hand  a foot from the ground he caught it just in time to pull his broom straight and he toppled gently onto the grass with the remembrall clutched safely in his fist harry potter his heart sank faster than hed just dived professor mcgonagall was running toward them he got to his feet trembling never  in all my time at hogwarts  professor mcgonagall was almost speechless with shock and her glasses flashed furiously  how dare you  might have broken your neck  it wasnt his fault professor  be quiet miss patil but malfoy  thats enough mr weasley potter follow me now harry caught sight of malfoy crabbe and goyles triumphant faces as he left walking numbly in professor mcgonagalls wake as she strode toward the castle he was going to be expelled he just knew it he wanted to say something to defend himself but there seemed to be something wrong with his voice professor mcgonagall was sweeping along without even looking at him he had to jog to keep up now hed done it he hadnt even lasted two weeks hed be packing his bags in ten minutes what would the dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep up the front steps up the marble staircase inside and still professor mcgonagall didnt say a word to him she wrenched open doors and marched along corridors with harry trotting miserably behind her maybe she was taking him to dumbledore he thought of hagrid expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper perhaps he could be hagrids assistant his stomach twisted as he imagined it watching ron and the others becoming wizards while he stumped around the grounds carrying hagrids bag professor mcgonagall stopped outside a classroom she opened the door and poked her head inside excuse me professor flitwick could i borrow wood for a moment wood thought harry bewildered was wood a cane she was going to use on him but wood turned out to be a person a burly fifthyear boy who came out of flitwicles class looking confused follow me you two said professor mcgonagall and they marched on up the corridor wood looking curiously at harry in here professor mcgonagall pointed them into a classroom that was empty except for peeves who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard out peeves she barked peeves threw the chalk into a bin which clanged loudly and he swooped out cursing professor mcgonagall slammed the door behind him and turned to face the two boys potter this is oliver wood wood  ive found you a seeker woods expression changed from puzzlement to delight are you serious professor absolutely said professor mcgonagall crisply the boys a natural ive never seen anything like it was that your first time on a broomstick potter harry nodded silently he didnt have a clue what was going on but he didnt seem to be being expelled and some of the feeling started coming back to his legs he caught that thing in his hand after a fiftyfoot dive professor mcgonagall told wood didnt even scratch himself charlie weasley couldnt have done it wood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once ever seen a game of quidditch potter he asked excitedly woods captain of the gryffindor team professor mcgonagall explained hes just the build for a seeker too said wood now walking around harry and staring at him light  speedy  well have to get him a decent broom professor  a nimbus two thousand or a cleansweep seven id say i shall speak to professor dumbledore and see if we cant bend the firstyear rule heaven knows we need a better team than last year flattened in that last match by slytherin i couldnt look severus snape in the face for weeks professor mcgonagall peered sternly over her glasses at harry i want to hear youre training hard potter or i may change my mind about punishing you then she suddenly smiled your father would have been proud she said he was an excellent quidditch player himself youre joking it was dinnertime harry had just finished telling ron what had happened when hed left the grounds with professor mcgonagall ron had a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth but hed forgotten all about it seeker he said but first years never  you must be the youngest house player in about a century said harry shoveling pie into his mouth he felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon wood told me ron was so amazed so impressed he just sat and gaped at harry i start training next week said harry only dont tell anyone wood wants to keep it a secret fred and george weasley now came into the hall spotted harry and hurried over well done said george in a low voice wood told us were on the team too  beaters i tell you were going to win that quidditch cup for sure this year said fred we havent won since charlie left but this years team is going to be brilliant you must be good harry wood was almost skipping when he told us anyway weve got to go lee jordan reckons hes found a new secret passageway out of the school bet its that one behind the statue of gregory the smarmy that we found in our first week see you fred and george had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up malfoy flanked by crabbe and goyle having a last meal potter when are you getting the train back to the muggles youre a lot braver now that youre back on the ground and youve got your little friends with you said harry coolly there was of course nothing at all little about crabbe and goyle but as the high table was full of teachers neither of them could do more than crack their knuckles and scowl id take you on anytime on my own said malfoy tonight if you want wizards duel wands only  no contact whats the matter never heard of a wizards duel before i suppose of course he has said ron wheeling around im his second whos yours malfoy looked at crabbe and goyle sizing them up crabbe he said midnight all right well meet you in the trophy room thats always unlocked when malfoy had gone ron and harry looked at each other what is a wizards duel said harry and what do you mean youre my second well a seconds there to take over if you die said ron casually getting started at last on his cold pie catching the look on harrys face he added quickly but people only die in proper duels you know with real wizards the most you and malfoyll be able to do is send sparks at each other neither of you knows enough magic to do any real damage i bet he expected you to refuse anyway and what if i wave my wand and nothing happens throw it away and punch him on the nose ron suggested excuse me they both looked up it was hermione granger cant a person eat in peace in this place said ron hermione ignored him and spoke to harry i couldnt help overhearing what you and malfoy were saying  bet you could ron muttered and you mustnt go wandering around the school at night think of the points youll lose gryffindor if youre caught and youre bound to be its really very selfish of you and its really none of your business said harry g
