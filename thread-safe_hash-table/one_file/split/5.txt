oodbye said ron all the same it wasnt what youd call the perfect end to the day harry thought as he lay awake much later listening to dean and seamus falling asleep neville wasnt back from the hospital wing ron had spent all evening giving him advice such as if he tries to curse you youd better dodge it because i cant remember how to block them there was a very good chance they were going to get caught by filch or mrs norris and harry felt he was pushing his luck breaking another school rule today on the other hand malfoys sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness  this was his big chance to beat malfoy facetoface he couldnt miss it halfpast eleven ron muttered at last wed better go they pulled on their bathrobes picked up their wands and crept across the tower room down the spiral staircase and into the gryffindor common room a few embers were still glowing in the fireplace turning all the armchairs into hunched black shadows they had almost reached the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them i cant believe youre going to do this harry a lamp flickered on it was hermione granger wearing a pink bathrobe and a frown you said ron furiously go back to bed i almost told your brother hermione snapped percy  hes a prefect hed put a stop to this harry couldnt believe anyone could be so interfering come on he said to ron he pushed open the portrait of the fat lady and climbed through the hole hermione wasnt going to give up that easily she followed ron through the portrait hole hissing at them like an angry goose dont you care about gryffindor do you only care about yourselves i dont want slytherin to win the house cup and youll lose all the points i got from professor mcgonagall for knowing about switching spells go away all right but i warned you you just remember what i said when youre on the train home tomorrow youre so  but what they were they didnt find out hermione had turned to the portrait of the fat lady to get back inside and found herself facing an empty painting the fat lady had gone on a nighttime visit and hermione was locked out of gryffindor tower now what am i going to do she asked shrilly thats your problem said ron weve got to go we 3 re going to be late they hadnt even reached the end of the corridor when hermione caught up with them im coming with you she said you are not dyou think im going to stand out here and wait for filch to catch me if he finds all three of us ill tell him the truth that i was trying to stop you and you can back me up youve got some nerve  said ron loudly shut up both of you said harry sharply i heard something it was a sort of snuffling mrs norris breathed ron squinting through the dark it wasnt mrs norris it was neville he was curled up on the floor fast asleep but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer thank goodness you found me ive been out here for hours i couldnt remember the new password to get in to bed keep your voice down neville the passwords pig snout but it wont help you now the fat ladys gone off somewhere hows your arm said harry fine said neville showing them madam pomfrey mended it in about a minute good  well look neville weve got to be somewhere well see you later  dont leave me said neville scrambling to his feet i dont want to stay here alone the bloody barons been past twice already ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at hermione and neville if either of you get us caught ill never rest until ive learned that curse of the bogies quirrell told us about and used it on you hermione opened her mouth perhaps to tell ron exactly how to use the curse of the bogies but harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all forward they flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the high windows at every turn harry expected to run into filch or mrs norris but they were lucky they sped up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the trophy room malfoy and crabbe werent there yet the crystal trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught them cups shields plates and statues winked silver and gold in the darkness they edged along the walls keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the room harry took out his wand in case malfoy leapt in and started at once the minutes crept by hes late maybe hes chickened out ron whispered then a noise in the next room made them jump harry had only just raised his wand when they heard someone speak and it wasnt malfoy sniff around my sweet they might be lurking in a corner it was filch speaking to mrs norris horrorstruck harry waved madly at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible they scurried silently toward the door away from filchs voice nevilles robes had barely whipped round the corner when they heard filch enter the trophy room theyre in here somewhere they heard him mutter probably hiding this way harry mouthed to the others and petrified they began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor they could hear filch getting nearer neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a run he tripped grabbed ron around the waist and the pair of them toppled right into a suit of armor the clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle run harry yelled and the four of them sprinted down the gallery not looking back to see whether filch was following  they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another harry in the lead without any idea where they were or where they were going  they ripped through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway hurtled along it and came out near their charms classroom which they knew was miles from the trophy room i think weve lost him harry panted leaning against the cold wall and wiping his forehead neville was bent double wheezing and spluttering i  told you hermione gasped clutching at the stitch in her chest i  told  you weve got to get back to gryffindor tower said ron quickly as possible malfoy tricked you hermione said to harry you realize that dont you he was never going to meet you  filch knew someone was going to be in the trophy room malfoy must have tipped him off harry thought she was probably right but he wasnt going to tell her that lets go it wasnt going to be that simple they hadnt gone more than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a classroom in front of them it was peeves he caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delight shut up peeves  please  youll get us thrown out peeves cackled wandering around at midnight ickle firsties tut tut tut naughty naughty youll get caughty not if you dont give us away peeves please should tell filch i should said peeves in a saintly voice but his eyes glittered wickedly its for your own good you know get out of the way snapped ron taking a swipe at peeves this was a big mistake students out of bed peeves bellowed students out of bed down the charms corridor ducking under peeves they ran for their lives right to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a door  and it was locked this is it ron moaned as they pushed helplessly at the door were done for this is the end they could hear footsteps filch running as fast as he could toward peevess shouts oh move over hermione snarled she grabbed harrys wand tapped the lock and whispered alohomora the lock clicked and the door swung open  they piled through it shut it quickly and pressed their ears against it listening which way did they go peeves filch was saying quick tell me say please dont mess with me peeves now where did they go shant say nothing if you dont say please said peeves in his annoying singsong voice all right please nothing ha haaa told you i wouldnt say nothing if you didnt say please ha ha haaaaaa and they heard the sound of peeves whooshing away and filch cursing in rage he thinks this door is locked harry whispered i think well be okay  get off neville for neville had been tugging on the sleeve of harrys bathrobe for the last minute what harry turned around  and saw quite clearly what for a moment he was sure hed walked into a nightmare  this was too much on top of everything that had happened so far they werent in a room as he had supposed they were in a corridor the forbidden corridor on the third floor and now they knew why it was forbidden they were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog a dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor it had three heads three pairs of rolling mad eyes three noses twitching and quivering in their direction three drooling mouths saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs it was standing quite still all six eyes staring at them and harry knew that the only reason they werent already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise but it was quickly getting over that there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant harry groped for the doorknob  between filch and death hed take filch they fell backward  harry slammed the door shut and they ran they almost flew back down the corridor filch must have hurried off to look for them somewhere else because they didnt see him anywhere but they hardly cared  all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them and that monster they didnt stop running until they reached the portrait of the fat lady on the seventh floor where on earth have you all been she asked looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed sweaty faces never mind that  pig snout pig snout panted harry and the portrait swung forward they scrambled into the common room and collapsed trembling into armchairs it was a while before any of them said anything neville indeed looked as if hed never speak again what do they think theyre doing keeping a thing like that locked up in a school said ron finally if any dog needs exercise that one does hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again you dont use your eyes any of you do you she snapped didnt you see what it was standing on the floor harry suggested i wasnt looking at its feet i was too busy with its heads no not the floor it was standing on a trapdoor its obviously guarding something she stood up glaring at them i hope youre pleased with yourselves we could all have been killed  or worse expelled now if you dont mind im going to bed ron stared after her his mouth open no we dont mind he said youd think we dragged her along wouldnt you but hermione had given harry something else to think about as he climbed back into bed the dog was guarding something what had hagrid said gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide  except perhaps hogwarts it looked as though harry had found out where the grubby littie package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was chapter ten halloween malfoy couldnt believe his eyes when he saw that harry and ron were still at hogwarts the next day looking tired but perfectly cheerful indeed by the next morning harry and ron thought that meeting the threeheaded dog had been an excellent adventure and they were quite keen to have another one in the meantime harry filled ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from gringotts to hogwarts and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection its either really valuable or really dangerous said ron or both said harry but as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was about two inches long they didnt have much chance of guessing what it was without further clues neither neville nor hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor all neville cared about was never going near the dog again hermione was now refusing to speak to harry and ron but she was such a bossy knowitall that they saw this as an added bonus all they really wanted now was a way of getting back at malfoy and to their great delight just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later as the owls flooded into the great hall as usual everyones attention was caught at once by a long thin package carried by six large screech owls harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him knocking his bacon to the floor they had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel harry ripped open the letter first which was lucky because it said do not open the parcel at the table it contains your new nimbus two thousand but i dont want everybody knowing youve got a broomstick or theyll all want one oliver wood will meet you tonight on the quidditch field at seven oclock for your first training session professor mcgonagall harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to ron to read a nimbus two thousand ron moaned enviously ive never even touched one they left the hall quickly wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private before their first class but halfway across the entrance hall they found the way upstairs barred by crabbe and goyle malfoy seized the package from harry and felt it thats a broomstick he said throwing it back to harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face youll be in for it this time potter first years arent allowed them ron couldnt resist it its not any old broomstick he said its a nimbus two thousand what did you say youve got at home malfoy a comet two sixty ron grinned at harry comets look flashy but theyre not in the same league as the nimbus what would you know about it weasley you couldnt afford half the handle malfoy snapped back i suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig before ron could answer professor flitwick appeared at malfoys elbow not arguing i hope boys he squeaked potters been sent a broomstick professor said malfoy quickly yes yes thats right said professor flitwick beaming at harry professor mcgonagall told me all about the special circumstances potter and what model is it a nimbus two thousand sit said harry fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on malfoys face and its really thanks to malfoy here that ive got it he added harry and ron headed upstairs smothering their laughter at malfoys obvious rage and confusion well its true harry chortled as they reached the top of the marble staircase if he hadnt stolen nevilles remembrall i woulnt be on the team so i suppose you think thats a reward for breaking rules came an angry voice from just behind them hermione was stomping up the stairs looking disapprovingly at the package in harrys hand i thought you werent speaking to us said harry yes dont stop now said ron its doing us so much good hermione marched away with her nose in the air harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day it kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed or straying off to the quidditch field where hed be learning to play that night he bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating and then rushed upstairs with ron to unwrap the nimbus two thousand at last wow ron sighed as the broomstick rolled onto harrys bedspread even harry who knew nothing about the different brooms thought it looked wonderful sleek and shiny with a mahogany handle it had a long tail of neat straight twigs and nimbus two thousand written in gold near the top as seven oclock drew nearer harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the quidditch field held never been inside the stadium before hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on at either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end they reminded harry of the little plastic sticks muggle children blew bubbles through except that they were fifty feet high too eager to fly again to wait for wood harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the ground what a feeling  he swooped in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field the nimbus two thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch hey potter come down oliver wood had arrived fie was carrying a large wooden crate under his arm harry landed next to him very nice said wood his eyes glinting i see what mcgonagall meant you really are a natural im just going to teach you the rules this evening then youll be joining team practice three times a week he opened the crate inside were four differentsized balls right said wood now quidditch is easy enough to understand even if its not too easy to play there are seven players on each side three of them are called chasers three chasers harry repeated as wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball this balls called the quaffle said wood the chasers throw the quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal ten points every time the quaffle goes through one of the hoops follow me the chasers throw the quaffle and put it through the hoops to score harry recited so  thats sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops isnt it whats basketball said wood curiously never mind said harry quickly now theres another player on each side whos called the keeper im keeper for gryffindor i have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring three chasers one keeper said harry who was determined to remember it all and they play with the quaffle okay got that so what are they for he pointed at the three balls left inside the box ill show you now said wood take this he handed harry a small club a bit like a short baseball bat im going to show you what the bludgers do wood said these two are the bludgers he showed harry two identical balls jet black and slightly smaller than the red quaffle harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps holding them inside the box stand back wood warned harry he bent down and freed one of the bludgers at once the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at harrys face harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking his nose and sent it zigzagging away into the air  it zoomed around their heads and then shot at wood who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground see wood panted forcing the struggling bludger back into the crate and strapping it down safely the bludgers rocket around trying to knock players off their brooms thats why you have two beaters on each team  the weasley twins are ours  its their job to protect their side from the bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team so  think youve got all that three chasers try and score with the quaffle the keeper guards the goal posts the beaters keep the bludgers away from their team harry reeled off very good said wood er  have the bludgers ever killed anyone harry asked hoping he sounded offhand never at hogwarts weve had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse than that now the last member of the team is the seeker thats you and you dont have to worry about the quaffle or the bludgers unless they crack my head open dont worry the weasleys are more than a match for the bludgers  i mean theyre like a pair of human bludgers themselves wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball compared with the quaffle and the bludgers it was tiny about the size of a large walnut it was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wings this said wood is the golden snitch and its the most important ball of the lot its very hard to catch because its so fast and difficult to see its the seekers job to catch it youve got to weave in and out of the chasers beaters bludgers and quaffle to get it before the other teams seeker because whichever seeker catches the snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points so they nearly always win thats why seekers get fouled so much a game of quidditch only ends when the snitch is caught so it can go on for ages  i think the record is three months they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep well thats it  any questions harry shook his head he understood what he had to do all right it was doing it that was going to be the problem we wont practice with the snitch yet said wood carefully shutting it back inside the crate its too dark we might lose it lets try you out with a few of these he pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few minutes later he and harry were up in the air wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could in every direction for harry to catch harry didnt miss a single one and wood was delighted after half an hour night had really fallen and they couldnt carry on that quidditch cupll have our name on it this year said wood happily as they trudged back up to the castle i wouldnt be surprised if you turn out better than charlie weasley and he could have played for england if he hadnt gone off chasing dragons perhaps it was because he was now so busy what with quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework but harry could hardly believe it when he realized that hed already been at hogwarts two months the castle felt more like home than privet drive ever had his lessons too were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics on halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors even better professor flitwick announced in charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly something they had all been dying to try since theyd seen him make nevilles toad zoom around the classroom professor flitwick put the class into pairs to practice harrys partner was seamus finnigan which was a relief because neville had been trying to catch his eye ron however was to be working with hermione granger it was hard to tell whether ron or hermione was angrier about this she hadnt spoken to either of them since the day harrys broomstick had arrived now dont forget that nice wrist movement weve been practicing squeaked professor flitwick perched on top of his pile of books as usual swish and flick remember swish and flick and saying the magic words properly is very important too  never forget wizard baruffio who said s instead of f and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest it was very difficult harry and seamus swished and flicked but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it  harry had to put it out with his hat ron at the next table wasnt having much more luck wingardium leviosa he shouted waving his long arms like a windmill youre saying it wrong harry heard hermione snap its winggardium leviosa make the gar nice and long you do it then if youre so clever ron snarled hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown flicked her wand and said wingardium leviosa their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their heads oh well done cried professor flitwick clapping everyone see here miss grangers done it ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class its no wonder no one can stand her he said to harry as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor shes a nightmare honestly  someone knocked into harry as they hurried past him it was hermione harry caught a glimpse of her face  and was startled to see that she was in tears i think she heard you so said ron but he looked a bit uncomfortable she mustve noticed shes got no friends hermione didnt turn up for the next class and wasnt seen all afternoon on their way down to the great hall for the halloween feast harry and ron overheard parvati patil telling her friend lavender that hermione was crying in the girls bathroom and wanted to be left alone ron looked still more awkward at this but a moment later they had entered the great hall where the halloween decorations put hermione out of their minds a thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds making the candles in the pumpkins stutter the feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates as it had at the startofterm banquet harry was just helping himself to a baked potato when professor quirrell came sprinting into the hall his turban askew and terror on his face everyone stared as he reached professor dumbledores chair slumped against the table and gasped troll  in the dungeons  thought you ought to know he then sank to the floor in a dead faint there was an uproar it took several purple firecrackers exploding from the end of professor dumbledores wand to bring silence prefects he rumbled lead your houses back to the dormitories immediately percy was in his element follow me stick together first years no need to fear the troll if you follow my orders stay close behind me now make way first years coming through excuse me im a prefect how could a troll get in harry asked as they climbed the stairs dont ask me theyre supposed to be really stupid said ron maybe peeves let it in for a halloween joke they passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions as they jostled their way through a crowd of confused hufflepuffs harry suddenly grabbed rons arm ive just thought  hermione what about her she doesnt know about the troll ron bit his lip oh all right he snapped but percyd better not see us ducking down they joined the hufflepuffs going the other way slipped down a deserted side corridor and hurried off toward the girls bathroom they had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them percy hissed ron pulling harry behind a large stone griffin peering around it however they saw not percy but snape he crossed the corridor and disappeared from view whats he doing harry whispered why isnt he down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers search me quietly as possible they crept along the next corridor after snapes fading footsteps hes heading for the third floor harry said but ron held up his hand can you smell something harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils a mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean and then they heard it  a low grunting and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet ron pointed  at the end of a passage to the left something huge was moving toward them they shrank into the shadows and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight it was a horrible sight twelve feet tall its skin was a dull granite gray its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a coconut it had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat horny feet the smell coming from it was incredible it was holding a huge wooden club which dragged along the floor because its arms were so long the troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside it waggled its long ears making up its tiny mind then slouched slowly into the room the keys in the lock harry muttered we could lock it in good idea said ron nervously they edged toward the open door mouths dry praying the troll wasnt about to come out of it with one great leap harry managed to grab the key slam the door and lock it yes flushed with their victory they started to run back up the passage but as they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts stop  a high petrified scream  and it was coming from the chamber theyd just chained up oh no said ron pale as the bloody baron its the girls bathroom harry gasped hermione they said together it was the last thing they wanted to do but what choice did they have wheeling around they sprinted back to the door and turned the key fumbling in their panic harry pulled the door open and they ran inside hermione granger was shrinking against the wall opposite looking as if she was about to faint the troll was advancing on her knocking the sinks off the walls as it went confuse it harry said desperately to ron and seizing a tap he threw it as hard as he could against the wall the troll stopped a few feet from hermione it lumbered around blinking stupidly to see what had made the noise its mean little eyes saw harry it hesitated then made for him instead lifting its club as it went oy peabrain yelled ron from the other side of the chamber and he threw a metal pipe at it the troll didnt even seem to notice the pipe hitting its shoulder but it heard the yell and paused again turning its ugly snout toward ron instead giving harry time to run around it come on run run harry yelled at hermione trying to pull her toward the door but she couldnt move she was still flat against the wall her mouth open with terror the shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk it roared again and started toward ron who was nearest and had no way to escape harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid he took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the trolls neck from behind the troll couldnt feel harry hanging there but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose and harrys wand had still been in his hand when hed jumped  it had gone straight up one of the trolls nostrils howling with pain the troll twisted and flailed its club with harry clinging on for dear life any second the troll was going to rip him off or catch him a terrible blow with the club hermione had sunk to the floor in fright ron pulled out his own wand  not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came into his head wingardium leviosa the club flew suddenly out of the trolls hand rose high high up into the air turned slowly over  and dropped with a sickening crack onto its owners head the troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face with a thud that made the whole room tremble harry got to his feet he was shaking and out of breath ron was standing there with his wand still raised staring at what he had done it was hermione who spoke first is it  dead i dont think so said harry i think its just been knocked out he bent down and pulled his wand out of the trolls nose it was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue urgh  troll boogers he wiped it on the trolls trousers a sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up they hadnt realized what a racket they had been making but of course someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the trolls roars a moment later professor mcgonagall had come bursting into the room closely followed by snape with quirrell bringing up the rear quirrell took one look at the troll let out a faint whimper and sat quickly down on a toilet clutching his heart snape bent over the troll professor mcgonagall was looking at ron and harry harry had never seen her look so angry her lips were white hopes of winning fifty points for gryffindor faded quickly from harrys mind what on earth were you thinking of said professor mcgonagall with cold fury in her voice harry looked at ron who was still standing with his wand in the air youre lucky you werent killed why arent you in your dormitory snape gave harry a swift piercing look harry looked at the floor he wished ron would put his wand down then a small voice came out of the shadows please professor mcgonagall  they were looking for me miss granger hermione had managed to get to her feet at last i went looking for the troll because i  i thought i could deal with it on my own  you know because ive read all about them ron dropped his wand hermione granger telling a downright lie to a teacher if they hadnt found me id be dead now harry stuck his wand up its nose and ron knocked it out with its own club they didnt have time to come and fetch anyone it was about to finish me off when they arrived harry and ron tried to look as though this story wasnt new to them well  in that case said professor mcgonagall staring at the three of them miss granger you foolish girl how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own hermione hung her head harry was speechless hermione was the last person to do anything against the rules and here she was pretending she had to get them out of trouble it was as if snape had started handing out sweets miss granger five points will be taken from gryffindor for this said professor mcgonagall im very disappointed in you if youre not hurt at all youd better get off to gryffindor tower students are finishing the feast in their houses hermione left professor mcgonagall turned to harry and ron well i still say you were lucky but not many first years could have taken on a fullgrown mountain troll you each win gryffindor five points professor dumbledore will be informed of this you may go they hurried out of the chamber and didnt speak at all until they had climbed two floors up it was a relief to be away from the smell of the troll quite apart from anything else we should have gotten more than ten points ron grumbled five you mean once shes taken off hermiones good of her to get us out of trouble like that ron admitted mind you we did save her she might not have needed saving if we hadnt locked the thing in with her harry reminded him they had reached the portrait of the fat lady pig snout they said and entered the common room was packed and noisy everyone was eating the food that had been sent up hermione however stood alone by the door waiting for them there was a very embarrassed pause then none of them looking at each other they all said thanks and hurried off to get plates but from that moment on hermione granger became their friend there are some things you cant share without ending up liking each other and knocking out a twelvefoot mountain troll is one of them chapter eleven quidditch as they entered november the weather turned very cold the mountains around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel every morning the ground was covered in frost hagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the quidditch field bundled up in a long moleskin overcoat rabbit fur gloves and enormous beaverskin boots the quidditch season had begun on saturday harry would be playing in his first match after weeks of training gryffindor versus slytherin if gryffindor won they would move up into second place in the house championship hardly anyone had seen harry play because wood had decided that as their secret weapon harry should be kept well secret but the news that he was playing seeker had leaked out somehow and harry didnt know which was worse  people telling him hed be brilliant or people telling him theyd be running around underneath him holding a mattress it was really lucky that harry now had hermlone as a friend he didnt know how hed have gotten through all his homework without her what with all the lastminute quidditch practice wood was making them do she had also tent him quidditch through the ages which turned out to be a very interesting read harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a world cup match in 1473 that seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players and that most serious quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them that although people rarely died playing quidditch referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the sahara desert hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since harry and ron had saved her from the mountain troll and she was much nicer for it the day before harrys first quidditch match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during break and she had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar they were standing with their backs to it getting warm when snape crossed the yard harry noticed at once that snape was limping harry ron and hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view they were sure it wouldnt be allowed unfortunately something about their guilty faces caught snapes eye he limped over he hadnt seen the fire but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them off anyway whats that youve got there potter it was quidditch through the ages harry showed him library books are not to be taken outside the school said snape give it to me five points from gryffindor hes just made that rule up harry muttered angrily as snape limped away wonder whats wrong with his leg dunno but i hope its really hurting him said ron bitterly the gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening harry ron and hermione sat together next to a window hermione was checking harry and rons charms homework for them she would never let them copy how will you learn but by asking her to read it through they got the right answers anyway harry felt restless he wanted quidditch through the ages back to take his mind off his nerves about tomorrow why should he be afraid of snape getting up he told ron and hermione he was going to ask snape if he could have it better you than me they said together but harry had an idea that snape wouldnt refuse if there were other teachers listening he made his way down to the staffroom and knocked there was no answer he knocked again nothing perhaps snape had left the book in there it was worth a try he pushed the door ajar and peered inside  and a horrible scene met his eyes snape and filch were inside alone snape was holding his robes above his knees one of his legs was bloody and mangled filch was handing snape bandages blasted thing snape was saying how are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at once harry tried to shut the door quietly but  potter snapes face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robes quickly to hide his leg harry gulped i just wondered if i could have my book back get out out harry left before snape could take any more points from gryffindor he sprinted back upstairs did you get it ron asked as harry joined them whats the matter in a low whisper harry told them what hed seen you know what this means he finished breathlessly he tried to get past that threeheaded dog at halloween thats where he was going when we saw him  hes after whatever its guarding and id bet my broomstick he let that troll in to make a diversion hermiones eyes were wide no  he wouldnt she said i know hes not very nice but he wouldnt try and steal something dumbledore was keeping safe honestly hermione you think all teachers are saints or

loudly but harry couldnt sleep he tried to empty his mind  he needed to sleep he had to he had his first quidditch match in a few hours  but the expression on snapes face when harry had seen his leg wasnt easy to forget the next morning dawned very bright and cold the great hall was full of the delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheer ful chatter of everyone looking forward to a good quidditch match youve got to eat some breakfast i dont want anything just a bit of toast wheedled hermione im not hungry harry felt terrible in an hours time hed be walking onto the field harry you need your strength said seamus finnigan seekers are always the ones who get clobbered by the other team thanks seamus said harry watching seamus pile ketchup on his sausages by eleven oclock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around the quidditch pitch many students had binoculars the seats might be raised high in the air but it was still difficult to see what was going on sometimes ron and hermione joined neville seamus and dean the west ham fan up in the top row as a surprise for harry they had painted a large banner on one of the sheets scabbers had ruined it said potter for president and dean who was good at drawing had done a large gryffindor lion underneath then hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that the paint flashed different colors meanwhile in the locker room harry and the rest of the team were changing into their scarlet quidditch robes slytherin would be playing in green wood cleared his throat for silence okay men he said and women said chaser angelina johnson and women wood agreed this is it the big one said fred weasley the one weve all been waiting for said george we know olivers speech by heart fred told harry we were on the team

followed fred and george out of the locker room and hoping his knees werent going to give way walked onto the field to loud cheers madam hooch was refereeing she stood in the middle of the field waiting for the two teams her broom in her hand now i want a nice fair game all of you she said once they were all gathered around her harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking particularly to the slytherin captain marcus flint a sixth year harry thought flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high above flashing potter for president over the crowd his heart skipped he felt braver mount your brooms please harry clambere
