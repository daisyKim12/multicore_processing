car when his parents had died sometimes when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard he came up with a strange vision a blinding flash of green light and a burn ing pain on his forehead this he supposed was the crash though he couldnt imagine where all the green light came from he couldnt remember his parents at all his aunt and uncle never spoke about them and of course he was forbidden to ask questions there were no photographs of them in the house when he had been younger harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away but it had never happened the dursleys were his only family yet sometimes he thought or maybe hoped that strangers in the street seemed to know him very strange strangers they were too a tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with aunt petunia and dudley after asking harry furiously if he knew the man aunt petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything a wildlooking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus a bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word the weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second harry tried to get a closer look at school harry had no one everybody knew that dudleys gang hated that odd harry potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses and nobody liked to disagree with dudleys gang chapter three the letters from no one the escape of the brazilian boa constrictor earned harry his longestever punishment by the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again the summer holidays had started and dudley had already broken his new video camera crashed his remote control airplane and first time out on his racing bike knocked down old mrs figg as she crossed privet drive on her crutches harry was glad school was over but there was no escaping dudleys gang who visited the house every single day piers dennis malcolm and gordon were all big and stupid but as dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot he was the leader the rest of them were all quite happy to join in dudleys favorite sport harry hunting this was why harry spent as much time as possible out of the house wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays where he could see a tiny ray of hope when september came he would be going off to secondary school and for the first time in his life he wouldnt be with dudley dudley had been accepted at uncle vernons old private school smeltings piers polkiss was going there too harry on the other hand was going to stonewall high the local public school dudley thought this was very funny they stuff peoples heads down the toilet the first day at stonewall he told harry want to come upstairs and practice no thanks said harry the poor toilets never had anything as horrible as your head down it  it might be sick then he ran before dudley could work out what hed said one day in july aunt petunia took dudley to london to buy his smeltings uniform leaving harry at mrs figgs mrs figg wasn t as bad as usual it turned out shed broken her leg tripping over one of her cats and she didnt seem quite as fond of them as before she let harry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though shed had it for several years that evening dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brandnew uniform smeltings boys wore maroon tailcoats orange knickerbockers and flat straw hats called boaters they also carried knobbly sticks used for hitting each other while the teachers werent looking this was supposed to be good training for later life as he looked at dudley in his new knickerbockers uncle vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life aunt petunia burst into tears and said she couldnt believe it was her ickle dudleykins he looked so handsome and grownup harry didnt trust himself to speak he thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh there was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when harry went in for breakfast it seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink he went to have a look the tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water whats this he asked aunt petunia her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question your new school uniform she said harry looked in the bowl again oh he said i didnt realize it had to be so wet dota be stupid snapped aunt petunia im dyeing some of dudleys old things gray for you itll look just like everyone elses when ive finished harry seriously doubted this but thought it best not to argue he sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his first day at stonewall high  like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin probably dudley and uncle vernon came in both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from harrys new uniform uncle vernon opened his newspaper as usual and dudley banged his smelting stick which he carried everywhere on the table they heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat get the mail dudley said uncle vernon from behind his paper make harry get it get the mail harry make dudley get it poke him with your smelting stick dudley harry dodged the smelting stick and went to get the mail three things lay on the doormat a postcard from uncle vernons sister marge who was vacationing on the isle of wight a brown envelope that looked like a bill and  a letter for harry harry picked it up and stared at it his heart twanging like a giant elastic band no one ever in his whole life had written to him who would he had no friends no other relatives  he didnt belong to the library so hed never even got rude notes asking for books back yet here it was a letter addressed so plainly there could be no mistake mr h potter the cupboard under the stairs 4 privet drive little whinging surrey the envelope was thick and heavy made of yellowish parchment and the address was written in emeraldgreen ink there was no stamp turning the envelope over his hand trembling harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms a lion an eagle a badger and a snake surrounding a large letter h hurry up boy shouted uncle vernon from the kitchen what are you doing checking for letter bombs he chuckled at his own joke harry went back to the kitchen still staring at his letter he handed uncle vernon the bill and the postcard sat down and slowly began to open the yellow envelope uncle vernon ripped open the bill snorted in disgust and flipped over the postcard marges ill he informed aunt petunia ate a funny whelk  dad said dudley suddenly dad harrys got something harry was on the point of unfolding his letter which was written on the same heavy parchment as the envelope when it was jerked sharply out of his hand by uncle vernon thats mine said harry trying to snatch it back whod be writing to you sneered uncle vernon shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at it his face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights and it didnt stop there within seconds it was the grayish white of old porridge pppetunia he gasped dudley tried to grab the letter to read it but uncle vernon held it high out of his reach aunt petunia took it curiously and read the first line for a moment it looked as though she might faint she clutched her throat and made a choking noise vernon oh my goodness  vernon they stared at each other seeming to have forgotten that harry and dudley were still in the room dudley wasnt used to being ignored he gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his smelting stick i want to read that letter he said loudly want to read it said harry furiously as its mine get out both of you croaked uncle vernon stuffing the letter back inside its envelope harry didnt move i want my letter he shouted let me see it demanded dudley out roared uncle vernon and he took both harry and dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall slamming the kitchen door behind them harry and dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole dudley won so harry his glasses dangling from one ear lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor vernon aunt petunia was saying in a quivering voice look at the address  how could they possibly know where he sleeps you dont think theyre watching the house watching  spying  might be following us muttered uncle vernon wildly but what should we do vernon should we write back tell them we dont want  harry could see uncle vernons shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchen no he said finally no well ignore it if they dont get an answer yes thats best we wont do anything but  im not having one in the house petunia didnt we swear when we took him in wed stamp out that dangerous nonsense that evening when he got back from work uncle vernon did something hed never done before he visited harry in his cupboard wheres my letter said harry the moment uncle vernon had squeezed through the door whos writing to me no one it was addressed to you by mistake said uncle vernon shortly i have burned it it was not a mistake said harry angrily it had my cupboard on it silence yelled uncle vernon and a couple of spiders fell from the ceiling he took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a smile which looked quite painful er  yes harry  about this cupboard your aunt and i have been thinking youre really getting a bit big for it we think it might be nice if you moved into dudleys second bedroom why said harry dont ask questions snapped his uncle take this stuff upstairs now the dursleys house had four bedrooms one for uncle vernon and aunt petunia one for visitors usually uncle vernons sister marge one where dudley slept and one where dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldnt fit into his first bedroom it only took harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room he sat down on the bed and stared around him nearly everything in here was broken the monthold video camera was lying on top of a small working tank dudley had once driven over the next door neighbors dog in the corner was dudleys firstever television set which hed put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled there was a large birdcage which had once held a parrot that dudley had swapped at school for a real air rifle which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because dudley had sat on it other shelves were full of books they were the only things in the room that looked as though theyd never been touched from downstairs came the sound of dudley bawling at his mother i dont want him in there i need that room make him get out harry sighed and stretched out on the bed yesterday hed have given anything to be up here today hed rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than up here without it next morning at breakfast everyone was rather quiet dudley was in shock hed screamed whacked his father with his smelting stick been sick on purpose kicked his mother and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof and he still didnt have his room back harry was thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing hed opened the letter in the hall uncle vernon and aunt petunia kept looking at each other darkly when the mail arrived uncle vernon who seemed to be trying to be nice to harry made dudley go and get it they heard him banging things with his smelting stick all the way down the hall then he shouted theres another one mr h potter the smallest bedroom 4 privet drive  with a strangled cry uncle vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the hall harry right behind him uncle vernon had to wrestle dudley to the ground to get the letter from him which was made difficult by the fact that harry had grabbed uncle vernon around the neck from behind after a minute of confused fighting in which everyone got hit a lot by the smelting stick uncle vernon straightened up gasping for breath with harrys letter clutched in his hand go to your cupboard  i mean your bedroom he wheezed at harry dudley  go  just go harry walked round and round his new room someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadnt received his first letter surely that meant theyd try again and this time hed make sure they didnt fail he had a plan the repaired alarm clock rang at six oclock the next morning harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently he mustnt wake the dursleys he stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights he was going to wait for the postman on the corner of privet drive and get the letters for number four first his heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall toward the front door  harry leapt into the air hed trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat  something alive lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror harry realized that the big squashy something had been his uncles face uncle vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag clearly making sure that harry didnt do exactly what hed been trying to do he shouted at harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time he got back the mail had arrived right into uncle vernons lap harry could see three letters addressed in green ink i want  he began but uncle vernon was tearing the letters into pieces before his eyes uncle vernon didnt go to work that day he stayed at home and nailed up the mail slot see he explained to aunt petunia through a mouthful of nails if they cant deliver them theyll just give up im not sure thatll work vernon oh these peoples minds work in strange ways petunia theyre not like you and me said uncle vernon trying to knock in a nail with the piece of fruitcake aunt petunia had just brought him on friday no less than twelve letters arrived for harry as they couldnt go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door slotted through the sides and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs bathroom uncle vernon stayed at home again after burning all the letters he got out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and back doors so no one could go out he hummed tiptoe through the tulips as he worked and jumped at small noises on saturday things began to get out of hand twentyfour letters to harry found their way into the house rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed aunt petunia through the living room window while uncle vernon made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to aunt petunia shredded the letters in her food processor who on earth wants to talk to you this badly dudley asked harry in amazement on sunday morning uncle vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and rather ill but happy no post on sundays he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade on his newspapers no damn letters today  something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of the head next moment thirty or forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets the dursleys ducked but harry leapt into the air trying to catch one out out uncle vernon seized harry around the waist and threw him into the hall when aunt petunia and dudley had run out with their arms over their faces uncle vernon slammed the door shut they could hear the letters still streaming into the room bouncing off the walls and floor that does it said uncle vernon trying to speak calmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at the same time i want you all back here in five minutes ready to leave were going away just pack some clothes no arguments he looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared argue ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the boardedup doors and were in the car speeding toward the highway dudley was sniffling in the back seat his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack his television vcr and computer in his sports bag they drove and they drove even aunt petunia didnt dare ask where they were going every now and then uncle vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while shakeem off shake em off he would mutter whenever he did this they didnt stop to eat or drink all day by nightfall dudley was howling hed never had such a bad day in his life he was hungry hed missed five television programs hed wanted to see and hed never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his computer uncle vernon stopped at last outside a gloomylooking hotel on the outskirts of a big city dudley and harry shared a room with twin beds and damp musty sheets dudley snored but harry stayed awake sitting on the windowsill staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering they ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day they had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their table scuse me but is one of you mr h potter only i got about an undred of these at the front desk she held up a letter so they could read the green ink address mr h potter room 17 railview hotel cokeworth harry made a grab for the letter but uncle vernon knocked his hand out of the way the woman stared ill take them said uncle vernon standing up quickly and following her from the dining room wouldnt it be better just to go home dear aunt petunia suggested timidly hours later but uncle vernon didnt seem to hear her exactly what he was looking for none of them knew he drove them into the middle of a forest got out looked around shook his head got back in the car and off they went again the same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field halfway across a suspension bridge and at the top of a multilevel parking garage daddys gone mad hasnt he dudley asked aunt petunia dully late that afternoon uncle vernon had parked at the coast locked them all inside the car and disappeared it started to rain great drops beat on the roof of the car dud ley sniveled its monday he told his mother the great humbertos on tonight i want to stay somewhere with a television  monday this reminded harry of something if it was monday  and you could usually count on dudley to know the days the week because of television  then tomorrow tuesday was harrys eleventh birthday of course his birthdays were never exactly fun  last year the dursleys had given him a coat hanger and a pair of uncle vernons old socks still you werent eleven every day uncle vernon was back and he was smiling he was also carrying a long thin package and didnt answer aunt petunia when she asked what hed bought found the perfect place he said come on everyone out it was very cold outside the car uncle vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine one thing was certain there was no television in there storm forecast for tonight said uncle vernon gleefully clapping his hands together and this gentlemans kindly agreed to lend us his boat a toothless old man came ambling up to them pointing with a rather wicked grin at an old rowboat bobbing in the irongray water below them ive already got us some rations said uncle vernon so all aboard it was freezing in the boat icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces after what seemed like hours they reached the rock where uncle vernon slipping and sliding led the way to the brokendown house the inside was horrible it smelled strongly of seaweed the wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls and the fireplace was damp and empty there were only two rooms uncle vernons rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four bananas he tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up could do with some of those letters now eh he said cheerfully he was in a very good mood obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail harry privately agreed though the thought didnt cheer him up at all as night fell the promised storm blew up around them spray from the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy windows aunt petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second room and made up a bed for dudley on the motheaten sofa she and uncle vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door and harry was left to find the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest most ragged blanket the storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on harry couldnt sleep he shivered and turned over trying to get comfortable his stomach rumbling with hunger dudleys snores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight the lighted dial of dudleys watch which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist told harry hed be eleven in ten minutes time he lay and watched his birthday tick nearer wondering if the dursleys would remember at all wondering where the letter writer was now five minutes to go harry heard something creak outside he hoped the roof wasnt going to fall in although he might be warmer if it did four minutes to go maybe the house in privet drive would be so full of letters when they got back that hed be able to steal one somehow three minutes to go was that the sea slapping hard on the rock like that and two minutes to go what was that funny crunching noise was the rock crumbling into the sea one minute to go and hed be eleven thirty seconds twenty  ten nine  maybe hed wake dudley up just to annoy him  three two one boom the whole shack shivered and harry sat bolt upright staring at the door someone was outside knocking to come in chapter four the keeper of the keys boom they knocked again dudley jerked awake wheres the cannon he said stupidly there was a crash behind them and uncle vernon came skidding into the room he was holding a rifle in his hands  now they knew what had been in the long thin package he had brought with them whos there he shouted i warn you  im armed there was a pause then  smash the door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor a giant of a man was standing in the doorway his face was almost completely hidden by a long shaggy mane of hair and a wild tangled beard but you could make out his eyes glinting like black beetles under all the hair the giant squeezed his way into the hut stooping so that his head just brushed the ceiling he bent down picked up the door and fitted it easily back into its frame the noise of the storm outside dropped a little he turned to look at them all couldnt make us a cup o tea could yeh its not been an easy journey he strode over to the sofa where dudley sat frozen with fear budge up yeh great lump said the stranger dudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother who was crouching terrified behind uncle vernon an heres harry said the giant harry looked up into the fierce wild shadowy face and saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile las time i saw you you was only a baby said the giant yeh look a lot like yet dad but yehve got yet moms eyes uncle vernon made a funny rasping noise i demand that you leave at once sit he said you are breaking and entering ah shut up dursley yeh great prune said the giant he reached over the back of the sofa jerked the gun out of uncle vernons hands bent it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber and threw it into a corner of the room uncle vernon made another funny noise like a mouse being trodden on anyway  harry said the giant turning his back on the dursleys a very happy birthday to yeh got summat fer yeh here  i mighta sat on it at some point but itll taste all right from an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly squashed box harry opened it with trembling fingers inside was a large sticky chocolate cake with happy birthday harry written on it in green icing harry looked up at the giant he meant to say thank you but the words got lost on the way to his mouth and what he said instead was who are you the giant chuckled true i havent introduced meself rubeus hagrid keeper of keys and grounds at hogwarts he held out an enormous hand and shook harrys whole arm what about that tea then eh he said rubbing his hands together id not say no ter summat stronger if yehve got it mind his eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it and he snorted he bent down over the fireplace they couldnt see what he was doing but when he drew back a second later there was a roaring fire there it filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and harry felt the warmth wash over him as though hed sunk into a hot bath the giant sat back down on the sofa which sagged under his weight and began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat a copper kettle a squashy package of sausages a poker a teapot several chipped mugs and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make tea soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage nobody said a thing while the giant was working but as he slid the first six fat juicy slightly burnt sausages from the poker dudley fidgeted a little uncle vernon said sharply dont touch anything he gives you dudley the giant chuckled darkly yet great puddin of a son don need fattenin anymore dursley don worry he passed the sausages to harry who was so hungry he had never tasted anything so wonderful but he still couldnt take his eyes off the giant finally as nobody seemed about to explain anything he said im sorry but i still dont really know who you are the giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand call me hagrid he said everyone does an like i told yeh im keeper of keys at hogwarts  yehll know all about hogwarts o course er  no said harry hagrid looked shocked sorry harry said quickly sony barked hagrid turning to stare at the dursleys who shrank back into the shadows it s them as should be sorry i knew yeh werent gettin yer letters but i never thought yeh wouldnt even know abou hogwarts fer cryin out loud did yeh never wonder where yet parents learned it all all what asked harry all what hagrid thundered now wait jus one second he had leapt to his feet in his anger he seemed to fill the whole hut the dursleys were cowering against the wall do you mean ter tell me he growled at the dursleys that this boy  this boy  knows nothin abou  about anything harry thought this was going a bit far he had been to school after all and his marks werent bad i know some things he said i can you know do math and stuff but hagrid simply waved his hand and said about our world i mean your world my world yer parents world what world hagrid looked as if he was about to explode dursley he boomed uncle vernon who had gone very pale whispered something that sounded like mimblewimble hagrid stared wildly at harry but yeh must know about yet mom and dad he said i mean theyre famous youre famous what my  my mom and dad werent famous were they yeh don know yeh don know hagrid ran his fingers through his hair fixing harry with a bewildered stare yeh don know what yeh are he said finally uncle vernon suddenly found his voice stop he commanded stop right there sit i forbid you to tell the boy anything a braver man than vernon dursley would have quailed under the furious look hagrid now gave him when hagrid spoke his every syllable trembled with rage you never told him never told him what was in the letter dumbledore left fer him i was there i saw dumbledore leave it dursley an youve kept it from him all these years kept what from me said harry eagerly stop i forbid you yelled uncle vernon in panic aunt petunia gave a gasp of horror ah go boil yet heads both of yeh said hagrid harry  yet a wizard there was silence inside the hut only the sea and the whistling wind could be heard  a what gasped harry a wizard o course said hagrid sitting back down on the sofa which groaned and sank even lower an a thumpin goodun id say once yehve been trained up a bit with a mum an dad like yours what else would yeh be an i reckon its abou time yeh read yer letter harry stretched out his hand at last to take the yellowish envelope addressed in emerald green to mr h potter the floor hutontherock the sea he pulled out the letter and read hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry headmaster albus dumbledore order of merlin first class grand sorc chf warlock supreme mugwump international confed of wizards dear mr potter we are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment term begins on september 1 we await your owl by no later than july 31 yours sincerely minerva mcgonagall deputy headmistress questions exploded inside harrys head like fireworks and he couldnt decide which to ask first after a few minutes he stammered what does it mean they await my owl gallopin gorgons that reminds me said hagrid clapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse and from yet another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl  a real live rather ruffledlooking owl  a long quill and a roll of parchment with his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that harry could read upside down dear professor dumbledore given harry his letter taking him to buy his things tomorrow weathers horrible hope youre well hagrid hagrid rolled up the note gave it to the owl which clamped it in its beak went to the door and threw the owl out into the storm then he came back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the telephone harry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly where was i said hagrid but at that moment uncle vernon still ashenfaced but looking very angry moved into the firelight hes not going he said hagrid grunted id like ter see a great muggle like you stop him he said a what said harry interested a muggle said hagrid its what we call nonmagic folk like thern an its your bad luck you grew up in a family o the biggest muggles i ever laid eyes on we swore when we took him in wed put a stop to that rubbish said uncle vernon swore wed stamp it out of him wizard indeed you knew said harry you knew im a  a wizard knew shrieked aunt petunia suddenly knew of course we knew how could you not be my dratted sister being what she was oh she got a letter just like that and disappeared off to thatthat schooland came home every vacation with her pockets full of frog spawn turning teacups into rats i was the only one who saw her for what she was  a freak but for my mother and father oh no it was lily this and lily that they were proud of having a witch in the family she stopped to draw a deep breath and then went ranting on it seemed she had been wanting to say all this for years then she met that potter at school and they left and got married and had you and of course i knew youd be just the same just as strange just as  as  abnormal  and then if you please she went and got herself blown up and we got landed with you harry had gone very white as soon as he found his voice he said blown up you told me they died in a car crash car crash roared hagrid jumping up so angrily that the dursleys scuttled back to their corner how could a car crash kill lily an james potter its an outrage a scandal harry potter not knowin his own story when every kid in our world knows his name but why what happened harry asked urgently the anger faded from hagrids face he looked suddenly anxious i never expected this he said in a low worried voice i had no idea when dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin hold of yeh how much yeh didnt know ah harry i don know if im the right person ter tell yeh  but someone 3 s gotta  yeh cant go off ter hogwarts not knowin he threw a dirty look at the dursleys well its best yeh know as much as i can tell yeh  mind i cant tell yeh everythin its a great mystry parts of it he sat down stared into the fire for a few seconds and then said it begins i suppose with  with a person called  but its incredible yeh dont know his name everyone in our world knows  who  well  i don like sayin the name if i can help it no one does why not gulpin gargoyles harry people are still scared blimey this is difficult see there was this wizard who went bad as bad as you could go worse worse than worse his name was hagrid gulped but no words came out could you write it down harry suggested nah cant spell it all right  voldemort  hagrid shuddered don make me say it again anyway this  this wizard about twenty years ago now started lookin fer followers got em too  some were afraid some just wanted a bit o his power cause he was gettin himself power all right dark days harry didnt know who ter trust didnt dare get friendly with strange wizards or witches terrible things happened he was takin over course some stood up to him  an he killed em horribly one o the only safe places left was hogwarts reckon dumbledores the only one youknowwho was afraid of didnt dare try takin the school not jus then anyway now yer mum an dad were as good a witch an wizard as i ever knew head boy an girl at hogwarts in their day suppose the mystry is why youknowwho never tried to get em on his side before probably knew they were too close ter dumbledore ter want anythin ter do with the dark side maybe he thought he could persuade em maybe he just wanted em outta the way all anyone knows is he turned up in the village where you was all living on halloween ten years ago you was just a year old he came ter yer house an  an  hagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty spotted handkerchief and blew his nose with a sound like a foghorn sorry he said but its that sad  knew yer mum an dad an nicer people yeh couldnt find  anyway youknowwho killed em an then  an this is the real mystry of the thing  he tried to kill you too wanted ter make a clean job of it i suppose or maybe he just liked killin by then but he couldnt do it never wondered how you got that mark on yer forehead that was no ordinary cut thats what yeh get when a powerful evil curse touches yeh  took care of yer mum an dad an yer house even  but it didnt work on you an thats why yer famous harry no one ever lived after he decided ter kill em no one except you an hed killed some o the best witches an wizards of the age  the mckinnons the bones the prewetts  an you was only a baby an you lived something very painful was going on in harrys mind as hagrids story came to a close he saw again the blinding flash of green light more clearly than he had ever remembered it before  and he remembered something else for the first time in his life a high cold cruel laugh hagrid was watching him sadly took yeh from the ruined house myself on dumbledores orders brought yeh ter this lot load of old tosh said uncle vernon harry jumped he had almost forgotten that the dursleys were there uncle vernon certainly seemed to have got back his courage he was glaring at hagrid and his fists were clenched now you listen here boy he snarled i accept theres something strange about you probably nothing a good beating wouldnt have cured  and as for all this about your parents well they were weirdos no denying it and the worlds better off without them in my opinion  asked for all they got getting mixed up with these wizarding types  just what i expected always knew theyd come to a sticky end  but at that moment hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink umbrella from inside his coat pointing this at uncle vernon like a sword he said im warning you dursley im warning you  one more word  in danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant uncle vernons courage failed again he flattened himself against the wall and fell silent thats better said hagrid breathing heavily and sitting back down on the sofa which this time sagged right down to the floor harry meanwhile still had questions to ask hundreds of them but what happened to vol sorry  i mean youknowwho good question harry disappeared vanished same night he tried ter kill you makes yeh even more famous thats the biggest mystry see he was gettin more an more powerful  whyd he go some say he died codswallop in my opinion dunno if he had enough human left in him to die some say hes still out there bidin his time like but i don believe it people who was on his side came back ter ours some of em came outta kinda trances don reckon they couldve done if he was comin back most of us reckon hes still out there somewhere but lost his powers too weak to carry on cause somethin about you finished him harry there was somethin goin on that night he hadnt counted on  i dunno what it was no one does  but somethin about you stumped him all right hagrid looked at harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes but harry instead of feeling pleased and proud felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake a wizard him how could he possibly be hed spent his life being clouted by dudley and bullied by aunt petunia and uncle vernon if he was really a wizard why hadnt they been turned into warty toads every time theyd tried to lock him in his cupboard if hed once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world how come dudley had always been able to kick him around like a football hagrid he said quietly i think you must have
