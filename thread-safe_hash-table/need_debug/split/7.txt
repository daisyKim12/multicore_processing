ad news hed just gotten very angry with the weasleys who kept divebombing each other and pretending to fall off their brooms will you stop messing around he yelled thats exactly the sort of thing thatll lose us the match snapes refereeing this time and hell be looking for any excuse to knock points off gryffindor george weasley really did fall off his broom at these words snapes refereeing he spluttered through a mouthful of mud whens he ever refereed a quidditch match hes not going to be fair if we might overtake slytherin the rest of the team landed next to george to complain too its not my fault said wood weve just got to make sure we play a clean game so snape hasnt got an excuse to pick on us which was all very well thought harry but he had another reason for not wanting snape near him while he was playing quidditch the rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice but harry headed straight back to the gryffindor common room where he found ron and hermione playing chess chess was the only thing hermione ever lost at something harry and ron thought was very good for her dont talk to me for a moment said ron when harry sat down next to him i need to concen  he caught sight of harrys face whats the matter with you you look terrible speaking quietly so that no one else would hear harry told the other two about snapes sudden sinister desire to be a quidditch referee dont play said hermione at once say youre ill said ron pretend to break your leg hermione suggested really break your leg said ron i cant said harry there isnt a reserve seeker if i back out gryffindor cant play at all at that moment neville toppled into the common room how he had managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyones guess because his legs had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the leglocker curse he must have had to bunny hop all the way up to gryffindor tower everyone fell over laughing except hermione who leapt up and performed the countercurse nevilles legs sprang apart and he got to his feet trembling what happened hermione asked him leading him over to sit with harry and ron malfoy said neville shakily i met him outside the library he said hed been looking for someone to practice that on go to professor mcgonagall hermione urged neville report him neville shook his head i dont want more trouble he mumbled youve got to stand up to him neville said ron hes used to walking all over people but thats no reason to lie down in front of him and make it easier theres no need to tell me im not brave enough to be in gryffindor malfoys already done that neville choked out harry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a chocolate frog the very last one from the box hermione had given him for christmas he gave it to neville who looked as though he might cry youre worth twelve of malfoy harry said the sorting hat chose you for gryffindor didnt it and wheres malfoy in stinking slytherin nevilles lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped the frog thanks harry i think ill go to bed dyou want the card you collect them dont you as neville walked away harry looked at the famous wizard card dumbledore again he said he was the first one i ever he gasped he stared at the back of the card then he looked up at ron and hermione ive found him he whispered ive found flamel i told you id read the name somewhere before i read it on the train coming here  listen to this dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard grindelwald in 1945 for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragons blood and his work on alchemy with his partner nicolas flamel hermione jumped to her feet she hadnt looked so excited since theyd gotten back the marks for their very first piece of homework stay there she said and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls dormitories harry and ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back an enormous old book in her arms i never thought to look in here she whispered excitedly i got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading light said ron but hermione told him to be quiet until shed looked something up and started flicking frantically through the pages muttering to herself at last she found what she was looking for i knew it i knew it are we allowed to speak yet said ron grumpily hermione ignored him nicolas flamel she whispered dramatically is the only known maker of the sorcerers stone this didnt have quite the effect shed expected the what said harry and ron oh honestly dont you two read look  read that there she pushed the book toward them and harry and ron read the ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the sorcerers stone a legendary substance with astonishing powers the stone will transform any metal into pure gold it also produces the elixir of life which will make the drinker immortal there have been many reports of the sorcerers stone over the centuries but the only stone currently in existence belongs to mr nicolas flamel the noted alchemist and opera lover mr flamel who celebrated his six hundred and sixtyfifth birthday last year enjoys a quiet life in devon with his wife perenelle six hundred and fiftyeight see said hermione when harry and ron had finished the dog must be guarding flamels sorcerers stone i bet he asked dumbledore to keep it safe for him because theyre friends and he knew someone was after it thats why he wanted the stone moved out of gringotts a stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying said harry no wonder snapes after it anyone would want it and no wonder we couldnt find flamel in that study of recent developments in wizardry said ron hes not exactly recent if hes six hundred and sixtyfive is he the next morning in defense against the dark arts while copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites harry and ron were still discussing what theyd do with a sorcerers stone if they had one it wasnt until ron said hed buy his own quidditch team that harry remembered about snape and the coming match im going to play he told ron and hermione if i dont all the slytherins will think im just too scared to face snape ill show them itll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win just as long as were not wiping you off the field said hermione as the match drew nearer however harry became more and more nervous whatever he told ron and hermione the rest of the team wasnt too calm either the idea of overtaking slytherin in the house championship was wonderful no one had done it for seven years but would they be allowed to with such a biased referee harry didnt know whether he was imagining it or not but he seemed to keep running into snape wherever he went at times he even wondered whether snape was following him trying to catch him on his own potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture snape was so horrible to harry could snape possibly know theyd found out about the sorcerers stone harry didnt see how he could  yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that snape could read minds harry knew when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon that ron and hermione were wondering whether theyd ever see him alive again this wasnt what youd call comforting harry hardly heard a word of woods pep talk as he pulled on his quidditch robes and picked up his nimbus two thousand ron and hermione meanwhile had found a place in the stands next to neville who couldnt understand why they looked so grim and worried or why they had both brought their wands to the match little did harry know that ron and hermione had been secretly practicing the leglocker curse theyd gotten the idea from malfoy using it on neville and were ready to use it on snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt harry now dont forget its locomotor mortis hermione muttered as ron slipped his wand up his sleeve i know ron snapped dont nag back in the locker room wood had taken harry aside dont want to pressure you potter but if we ever need an early capture of the snitch its now finish the game before snape can favor hufflepuff too much the whole schools out there said fred weasley peering out of the door even  blimey  dumbledores come to watch harrys heart did a somersault dumbledore he said dashing to the door to make sure fred was right there was no mistaking that silver beard harry could have laughed out loud with relief he was safe there was simply no way that snape would dare to try to hurt him if dumbledore was watching perhaps that was why snape was looking so angry as the teams marched onto the field something that ron noticed too ive never seen snape look so mean he told hermione look theyre off ouch someone had poked ron in the back of the head it was malfoy oh sorry weasley didnt see you there malfoy grinned broadly at crabbe and goyle wonder how long potters going to stay on his broom this time anyone want a bet what about you weasley ron didnt answer snape had just awarded hufflepuff a penalty because george weasley had hit a bludger at him hermione who had all her fingers crossed in her lap was squinting fixedly at harry who was circling the game like a hawk looking for the snitch you know how i think they choose people for the gryffindor team said malfoy loudly a few minutes later as snape awarded hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all its people they feel sorry for see theres potter whos got no parents then theres the weasleys whove got no money  you should be on the team longbottom youve got no brains neville went bright red but turned in his seat to face malfoy im worth twelve of you malfoy he stammered malfoy crabbe and goyle howled with laughter but ron still not daring to take his eyes from the game said you tell him neville longbottom if brains were gold youd be poorer than weasley and thats saying something rons nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about harry im warning you malfoy  one more word ron said hermione suddenly harry  what where harry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd hermione stood up her crossed fingers in her mouth as harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet youre in luck weasley potters obviously spotted some money on the ground said malfoy ron snapped before malfoy knew what was happening ron was on top of him wrestling him to the ground neville hesitated then clambered over the back of his seat to help come on harry hermione screamed leaping onto her seat to watch as harry sped straight at snape  she didnt even notice malfoy and ron rolling around under her seat or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was neville crabbe and goyle up in the air snape turned on his broomstick just in time to see something scarlet shoot past him missing him by inches  the next second harry had pulled out of the dive his arm raised in triumph the snitch clasped in his hand the stands erupted it had to be a record no one could ever remember the snitch being caught so quickly ron ron where are you the games over harrys won weve won gryffindor is in the lead shrieked hermione dancing up and down on her seat and hugging parvati patil in the row in front harry jumped off his broom a foot from the ground he couldnt believe it hed done it  the game was over it had barely lasted five minutes as gryffindors came spilling onto the field he saw snape land nearby whitefaced and tightlipped  then harry felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up into dumbledores smiling face well done said dumbledore quietly so that only harry could hear nice to see you havent been brooding about that mirror been keeping busy excellent snape spat bitterly on the ground harry left the locker room alone some time later to take his nimbus two thousand back to the broomshed he couldnt ever remember feeling happier hed really done something to be proud of now  no one could say he was just a famous name any more the evening air had never smelled so sweet he walked over the damp grass reliving the last hour in his head which was a happy blur gryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders ron and hermione in the distance jumping up and down ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed harry had reached the shed he leaned against the wooden door and looked up at hogwarts with its windows glowing red in the setting sun gryffindor in the lead hed done it hed shown snape and speaking of snape a hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle clearly not wanting to be seen it walked as fast as possible toward the forbidden forest harrys victory faded from his mind as he watched he recognized the figures prowling walk snape sneaking into the forest while everyone else was at dinner  what was going on harry jumped back on his nimbus two thousand and took off gliding silently over the castle he saw snape enter the forest at a run he followed the trees were so thick he couldnt see where snape had gone he flew in circles lower and lower brushing the top branches of trees until he heard voices he glided toward them and landed noiselessly in a towering beech tree he climbed carefully along one of the branches holding tight to his broomstick trying to see through the leaves below in a shadowy clearing stood snape but he wasnt alone quirrell was there too harry couldnt make out the look on his face but he was stuttering worse than ever harry strained to catch what they were saying  ddont know why you wanted ttto meet here of all pplaces severus oh i thought wed keep this private said snape his voice icy students arent supposed to know about the sorcerers stone after all harry leaned forward quirrell was mumbling something snape interrupted him have you found out how to get past that beast of hagrids yet bbbut severus i  you dont want me as your enemy quirrell said snape taking a step toward him ii dont know what you you know perfectly well what i mean an owl hooted loudly and harry nearly fell out of the tree he steadied himself in time to hear snape say  your little bit of hocuspocus im waiting bbut i dddont  very well snape cut in well have another little chat soon when youve had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties lie he threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing it was almost dark now but harry could see quirrell standing quite still as though he was petrified harry where have you been hermione squeaked we won you won we won shouted ron thumping harry on the back and i gave malfoy a black eye and neville tried to take on crabbe and goyle singlehanded hes still out cold but madam pomftey says hell be all right  talk about showing slytherin everyones waiting for you in the common room were having a party fred and george stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens never mind that now said harry breathlessly lets find an empty room you wait til you hear this he made sure peeves wasnt inside before shutting the door behind them then he told them what hed seen and heard so we were right it is the sorcerers stone and snapes trying to force quirrell to help him get it he asked if he knew how to get past fluffy  and he said something about quirrells hocus pocuss i reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart from fluffy loads of enchantments probably and quirrell would have done some antidark arts spell that snape needs to break through  so you mean the stones only safe as long as quirrell stands up to snape said hermione in alarm itll be gone by next tuesday said ron chapter fourteen norbert the norwegian ridgeback quirrell however must have been braver than theyd thought in the weeks that followed he did seem to be getting paler and thinner but it didnt look as though hed cracked yet every time they passed the thirdfloor corridor harry ron and hermione would press their ears to the door to check that fluffy was still growling inside snape was sweeping about in his usual bad temper which surely meant that the stone was still safe whenever harry passed quirrell these days he gave him an encouraging sort of smile and ron had started telling people off for laughing at quirrells stutter hermione however had more on her mind than the sorcerers stone she had started drawing up study schedules and colorcoding all her notes harry and ron wouldnt have minded but she kept nagging them to do the same hermione the exams are ages away ten weeks hermione snapped thats not ages thats like a second to nicolas flamel but were not six hundred years old ron reminded her anyway what are you studying for you already know it a what am i studying for are you crazy you realize we need to pass these exams to get into the second year theyre very important i should have started studying a month ago i dont know whats gotten into me unfortunately the teachers seemed to be thinking along the same lines as hermione they piled so much homework on them that the easter holidays werent nearly as much fun as the christmas ones it was hard to relax with hermione next to you reciting the twelve uses of dragons blood or practicing wand movements moaning and yawning harry and ron spent most of their free time in the library with her trying to get through all their extra work ill never remember this ron burst out one afternoon throwing down his quill and looking longingly out of the library window it was the first really fine day theyd had in months the sky was a clear forgetmenot blue and there was a feeling in the air of summer coming harry who was looking up dittany in one thousand magical herbs and fungi didnt look up until he heard ron say hagrid what are you doing in the library hagrid shuffled into view hiding something behind his back he looked very out of place in his moleskin overcoat jus lookin he said in a shifty voice that got their interest at once an whatre you lot up ter he looked suddenly suspicious yer not still lookin fer nicolas flamel are yeh oh we found out who he is ages ago said ron impressively and we know what that dogs guarding its a sorcerers st  shhhh hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was listening don go shoutin about it whats the matter with yeh there are a few things we wanted to ask you as a matter of fact said harry about whats guarding the stone apart from fluffy  shhhh said hagrid again listen  come an see me later im not promisin ill tell yeh anythin mind but don go rabbitin about it in here students aren spposed ter know theyll think ive told yeh  see you later then said harry hagrid shuffled off what was he hiding behind his back said hermione thoughtfully do you think it had anything to do with the stone im going to see what section he was in said ron whod had enough of working he came back a minute later with a pile of books in his arms and slammed them down on the table dragons he whispered hagrid was looking up stuff about dragons look at these dragon species of great britain and ireland from egg to inferno a dragon keepers guide hagrids always wanted a dragon he told me so the first time i ever met him  said harry but its against our laws said ron dragon breeding was outlawed by the warlocks convention of 1709 everyone knows that its hard to stop muggles from noticing us if were keeping dragons in the back garden  anyway you cant tame dragons its dangerous you should see the burns charlies got off wild ones in romania but there arent wild dragons in britain said harry of course there are said ron common welsh green and hebridean blacks the ministry of magic has a job hushing them up i can tell you our kind have to keep putting spells on muggles whove spotted them to make them forget so what on earths hagrid up to said hermione when they knocked on the door of the gamekeepers hut an hour later they were surprised to see that all the curtains were closed hagrid called who is it before he let them in and then shut the door quickly behind them it was stifling hot inside even though it was such a warm day there was a blazing fire in the grate hagrid made them tea and offered them stoat sandwiches which they refused so  yeh wanted to ask me somethin yes said harry there was no point beating around the bush we were wondering if you could tell us whats guarding the sorcerers stone apart from fluffy hagrid frowned at him 0 course i cant he said number one i don know meself number two yeh know too much already so i wouldn tell yeh if i could that stones here fer a good reason it was almost stolen outta gringotts  i sppose yehve worked that out an all beats me how yeh even know abou fluffy oh come on hagrid you might not want to tell us but you do know you know everything that goes on round here said hermione in a warm flattering voice hagrids beard twitched and they could tell he was smiling we only wondered who had done the guarding really hermione went on we wondered who dumbledore had trusted enough to help him apart from you hagrids chest swelled at these last words harry and ron beamed at hermione well i don spose it could hurt ter tell yeh that lets see he borrowed fluffy from me then some o the teachers did enchantments professor sprout  professor flitwick  professor mcgonagall  he ticked them off on his fingers professor quirrell  an dumbledore himself did somethin o course hang on ive forgotten someone oh yeah professor snape snape yeah  yer not still on abou that are yeh look snape helped protect the stone hes not about ter steal it harry knew ron and hermione were thinking the same as he was if snape had been in on protecting the stone it must have been easy to find out how the other teachers had guarded it he probably knew everything  except it seemed quirrells spell and how to get past fluffy youre the only one who knows how to get past fluffy arent you hagrid said harry anxiously and you wouldnt tell anyone would you not even one of the teachers not a soul knows except me an dumbledore said hagrid proudly well thats something harry muttered to the others hagrid can we have a window open im boiling cant harry sorry said hagrid harry noticed him glance at the fire harry looked at it too hagrid  whats that but he already knew what it was in the very heart of the fire underneath the kettle was a huge black egg ah said hagrid fiddling nervously with his beard thats er where did you get it hagrid said ron crouching over the fire to get a closer look at the egg it mustve cost you a fortune won it said hagrid las night i was down in the village havin a few drinks an got into a game o cards with a stranger think he was quite glad ter get rid of it ter be honest but what are you going to do with it when its hatched said hermione well ive bin doin some readin  said hagrid pulling a large book from under his pillow got this outta the library  dragon breeding for pleasure and profit  its a bit outta date o course but its all in here keep the egg in the fire cause their mothers breathe on i em see an when it hatches feed it on a bucket o brandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour an see here  how ter recognize diffrent eggs  what i got theres a norwegian ridgeback theyre rare them he looked very pleased with himself but hermione didnt hagrid you live in a wooden house she said but hagrid wasnt listening he was humming merrily as he stoked the fire so now they had something else to worry about what might happen to hagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hut wonder what its like to have a peaceful life ron sighed as evening after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were getting hermione had now started making study schedules for harry and ron too it was driving them nuts then one breakfast time hedwig brought harry another note from hagrid he had written only two words its hatching ron wanted to skip herbology and go straight down to the hut hermione wouldnt hear of it hermione how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon hatching weve got lessons well get into trouble and thats nothing to what hagrids going to be in when someone finds out what hes doing  shut up harry whispered malfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen how much had he heard harry didnt like the look on malfoys face at all ron and hermione argued all the way to herbology and in the end hermione agreed to run down to hagrids with the other two during morning break when the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their lesson the three of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge of the forest hagrid greeted them looking flushed and excited its nearly out he ushered them inside the egg was lying on the table there were deep cracks in it something was moving inside a funny clicking noise was coming from it they all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with bated breath all at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open the baby dragon flopped onto the table it wasnt exactly pretty harry thought it looked like a crumpled black umbrella its spiny wings were huge compared to its skinny jet body it had a long snout with wide nostrils the stubs of horns and bulging orange eyes it sneezed a couple of sparks flew out of its snout isnt he beautiful hagrid murmured he reached out a hand to stroke the dragons head it snapped at his fingers showing pointed fangs bless him look he knows his mommy said hagrid hagrid said hermione how fast do norwegian ridgebacks grow exactly hagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly drained from his face  he leapt to his feet and ran to the window whats the matter someone was lookin through the gap in the curtains  its a kid  hes runnin back up ter the school harry bolted to the door and looked out even at a distance there was no mistaking him malfoy had seen the dragon something about the smile lurking on malfoys face during the next week made harry ron and hermione very nervous they spent most of their free time in hagrids darkened hut trying to reason with him just let him go harry urged set him free i cant said hagrid hes too little hed die they looked at the dragon it had grown three times in length in just a week smoke kept furling out of its nostrils hagrid hadnt been doing his gamekeeping duties because the dragon was keeping him so busy there were empty brandy bottles and chicken feathers all over the floor ive decided to call him norbert said hagrid looking at the dragon with misty eyes he really knows me now watch norbert norbert wheres mommy hes lost his marbles ron muttered in harrys ear hagrid said harry loudly give it two weeks and norberts going to be as long as your house malfoy could go to dumbledore at any moment hagrid bit his lip i  i know i cant keep him forever but i cant jus dump him i cant harry suddenly turned to ron charlie he said youre losing it too said ron im ron remember no  charlie  your brother charlie in romania studying dragons we could send norbert to him charlie can take care of him and then put him back in the wild brilliant said ron how about it hagrid and in the end hagrid agreed that they could send an owl to charlie to ask him the following week dragged by wednesday night found hermione and harry sitting alone in the common room long after everyone else had gone to bed the clock on the wall had just chimed midnight when the portrait hole burst open ron appeared out of nowhere as he pulled off harrys invisibility cloak he had been down at hagrids hut helping him feed norbert who was now eating dead rats by the crate it bit me he said showing them his hand which was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief im not going to be able to hold a quill for a week i tell you that dragons the most horrible animal ive ever met but the way hagrid goes on about it youd think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit when it bit me he told me off for frightening it and when i left he was singing it a lullaby there was a tap on the dark window its hedwig said harry hurrying to let her in shell have charlies answer the three of them put their heads together to read the note dear ron how are you thanks for the letter  id be glad to take the norwegian ridgeback but it wont be easy getting him here i think the best thing will be to send him over with some friends of mine who are coming to visit me next week trouble is they mustnt be seen carrying an illegal dragon could you get the ridgeback up the tallest tower at midnight on saturday they can meet you there and take him away while its still dark send me an answer as soon as possible love charlie they looked at one another weve got the invisibility cloak said harry it shouldnt be too difficult  i think the cloaks big enough to cover two of us and norbert it was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two agreed with him anything to get rid of norbert  and malfoy there was a hitch by the next morning rons bitten hand had swollen to twice its usual size he didnt know whether it was safe to go to madam pomfrey  would she recognize a dragon bite by the afternoon though he had no choice the cut had turned a nasty shade of green it looked as if norberts fangs were poisonous harry and hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day to find ron in a terrible state in bed its not just my hand he whispered although that feels like its about to fall off malfoy told madam pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he could come and have a good laugh at me he kept threatening to tell her what really bit me  ive told her it was a dog but i dont think she believes me i shouldnt have hit him at the quidditch match thats why hes doing this harry and hermione tried to calm ron down itll all be over at midnight on saturday said hermione but this didnt soothe ron at all on the contrary he sat bolt upright and broke into a sweat midnight on saturday he said in a hoarse voice oh no oh no  ive just remembered  charlies letter was in that book malfoy took hes going to know were getting rid of norbert harry and hermione didnt get a chance to answer madam pomfrey came over at that moment and made them leave saying ron needed sleep its too late to change the plan now harry told hermione we havent got time to send charlie another owl and this could be our only chance to get rid of norbert well have to risk it and we have got the invisibility cloak malfoy doesnt know about that they found fang the boarhound sitting outside with a bandaged tail when they went to tell hagrid who opened a window to talk to them i wont let you in he puffed norberts at a tricky stage  nothin i cant handle when they told him about charlies letter his eyes filled with tears although that might have been because norbert had just bitten him on the leg aargh its all right he only got my boot  jus playin  hes only a baby after all the baby banged its tail on the wall making the windows rattle harry and hermione walked back to the castle feeling saturday couldnt come quickly enough they would have felt sorry for hagrid when the time came for him to say goodbye to norbert if they hadnt been so worried about what they had to do it was a very dark cloudy night and they were a bit late arriving at hagrids hut because theyd had to wait for peeves to get out of their way in the entrance hall where hed been playing tennis against the wall hagrid had norbert packed and ready in a large crate hes got lots o rats an some brandy fer the journey said hagrid in a muffled voice an ive packed his teddy bear in case he gets lonely from inside the crate came ripping noises that sounded to harry as though the teddy was having his head torn off byebye norbert hagrid sobbed as harry and hermione covered the crate with the invisibility cloak and stepped underneath it themselves mommy will never forget you how they managed to get the crate back up to the castle they never knew midnight ticked nearer as they heaved norbert up the marble staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors up another staircase then another  even one of harrys shortcuts didnt make the work much easier nearly there harry panted as they reached the corridor beneath the tallest tower then a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the crate forgetting that they were already invisible they shrank into the shadows staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each other ten feet away a lamp flared professor mcgonagall in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net had malfoy by the ear detention she shouted and twenty points from slytherin wandering around in the middle of the night how dare you  you dont understand professor harry potters coming  hes got a dragon what utter rubbish how dare you tell such lies come on  i shall see professor snape about you malfoy the steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest thing in the world after that not until theyd stepped out into the cold night air did they throw off the cloak glad to be able to breathe properly again hermione did a sort of jig malfoys got detention i could sing dont harry advised her chuckling about malfoy they waited norbert thrashing about in his crate about ten minutes later four broomsticks came swooping down out of the darkness charlies friends were a cheery lot they showed harry and hermione the harness theyd rigged up so they could suspend norbert between them they all helped buckle norbert safely into it and then harry and hermione shook hands with the others and thanked them very much at last norbert was going going gone they slipped back down the spiral staircase their hearts as light as their hands now that norbert was off them no more dragon  malfoy in detention  what could spoil their happiness the answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs as they stepped into the corridor filchs face loomed suddenly out of the darkness well well well he whispered we are in trouble theyd left the invisibility cloak on top of the tower chapter fifteen the foribidden forest things couldnt have been worse filch took them down to professor mcgonagalls study on the first floor where they sat and waited without saying a word to each other hermione was trembling excuses alibis and wild cover up stories chased each other around harrys brain each more feeble than the last he couldnt see how they were going to get out of trouble this time they were cornered how could they have been so stupid as to forget the cloak there was no reason on earth that professor mcgonagall would accept for their being out of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of night let alone being up the tallest astronomy tower which was outofbounds except for classes add norbert and the invisibility cloak and they might as well be packing their bags already had harry thought that things couldnt have been worse he was wrong when professor mcgonagall appeared she was leading neville harry neville burst out the moment he saw the other two i was trying to find you to warn you i heard malfoy saying he was going to catch you he said you had a drag  harry shook his head violently to shut neville up but professor mcgonagall had seen she looked more likely to breathe fire than norbert as she towered over the three of them i would never have believed it of any of you mr filch says you were up in the astronomy tower its one oclock in the morning explain yourselves it was the first time hermione had ever failed to answer a teachers question she was staring at her slippers as still as a statue i think ive got a good idea of whats been going on said professor mcgonagall it doesnt take a genius to work it out you fed draco malfoy some cockandbull story about a dragon trying to get him out of bed and into trouble ive already caught him i suppose you think its funny that longbottom here heard the story and believed it too harry caught nevilles eye and tried to tell him without words that this wasnt true because neville was looking stunned and hurt poor blundering neville  harry knew what it must have cost him to try and find them in the dark to warn them im disgusted said professor mcgonagall four students out of bed in one night ive never heard of such a thing before you miss granger i thought you had more sense as for you mr potter i thought gryffindor meant more to you than this all three of you will receive detentions  yes you too mr longbottom nothing gives you the right to walk around school at night especially these days its very dangerous  and fifty points will be taken from gryffindor fifty harry gasped  they would lose the lead the lead hed won in the last quidditch match fifty points each said professor mcgonagall breathing heavily through her long pointed nose professor  please you cant  dont tell me what i can and cant do potter now get back to bed all of you ive never been more ashamed of gryffindor students a hundred and fifty points lost that put gryffindor in last place in one night theyd ruined any chance gryffindor had had for the house cup harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach how could they ever make up for this harry didnt sleep all night he could hear neville sobbing into his pillow for what seemed like hours harry couldnt think of anything to say to comfort him he knew neville like himself was dreading the dawn what would happen when the rest of gryffindor found out what theyd done at first gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses that recorded the house points the next day thought thered been a mistake how could they suddenly have a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday and then the story started to spread harry potter the famous harry potter their hero of two quidditch matches had lo st them all those points him and a couple of other stupid first years from being one of the most popular and admired people at the school harry was suddenly the most hated even ravenclaws and hufflepuffs turned on him because everyone had been longing to see slytherin lose the house cup everywhere harry went people pointed and didnt trouble to lower their voices as they insulted him slytherins on the other hand clapped as he walked past them whistling and cheering thanks potter we owe you one only ron stood by him theyll all forget this in a few weeks fred and george have lost loads of points in all the time theyve been here and people still like them theyve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go though have they said harry miserably well  no ron admitted it was a bit late to repair the damage but harry swore to himself not to meddle in things that werent his business from now on hed had it with sneaking around and spying he felt so ashamed of himself that he went to wood and offered to resign from the quidditch team resign wood thundered what goodll that do how are we going to get any points back if we cant win at quidditch but even quidditch had lost its fun the rest of the team wouldnt speak to harry during practice and if they had to speak about him they called him the seeker hermione and neville were suffering too they didnt have as bad a time as harry because they werent as wellknown but nobody would speak to them either hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in class keeping her head down and working in silence harry was almost glad that the exams werent far away all the studying he had to do kept his mind off his misery he ron and hermione kept to themselves working late into the night trying to remember the ingredients in complicated potions learn charms and spells by heart memorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions then about a week before the exams were due to start harrys new resolution not to interfere in anything that didnt concern him was put to an unexpected test walking back from the library on his own one afternoon he heard somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead as he drew closer he heard quirrells voice no  no  not again please  it sounded as though someone was threatening him harry moved closer all right  all right  he heard quirrell sob next second quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom straightening his turban he was pale and looked as though he was about to cry he strode out of sight harry didnt think quirrell had even noticed him he waited until quirrells footsteps had disappeared

gambled twelve sorcerers stones that snape had just left the room and from what harry had just heard snape would be walking with a new spring in his step  quirrell seemed to have given in at last harry went back to the library where hermione was testing ron on astronomy harry told them what hed heard snapes done it then said ron if quirrells told him how to break his antidark force spell  theres still fluffy though said hermione maybe snapes found out how to get past him without asking hagrid said ron looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them i bet theres a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant threeheaded dog so what do we do harry the light of adventure was kindling again in rons eyes but hermione answered before harry could go to dumbledore
