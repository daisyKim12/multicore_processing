 got no proof said harry quirrells too scared to back us up snapes only got to say he doesnt know how the troll got in at halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor  who do you think theyll believe him or us its not exactly a secret we hate him dumbledorell think we made it up to get him sacked filch wouldnt help us if his life depended on it hes too friendly with snape and the more students get thrown out the better hell think and dont forget were not supposed to know about the stone or fluffy thatll take a lot of explaining hermione looked convinced but ron didnt if we just do a bit of poking around  no said harry flatly weve done enough poking around he pulled a map of jupiter toward him and started to learn the names of its moons the following morning notes were delivered to harry hermione and neville at the breakfast table they were all the same your detention will take place at eleven oclock tonight meet mr filch in the entrance hall professor mcgonagall harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in the furor over the points theyd lost he half expected hermione to complain that this was a whole night of studying lost but she didnt say a word like harry she felt they deserved what theyd got at eleven oclock that night they said goodbye to ron in the common room and went down to the entrance hall with neville filch was already there  and so was malfoy harry had also forgotten that malfoy had gotten a detention too follow me said filch lighting a lamp and leading them outside i bet youll think twice about breaking a school rule again wont you eh he said leering at them oh yes hard work and pain are the best teachers if you ask me its just a pity they let the old punishments die out hang you by your wrists from the ceiling for a few days ive got the chains still in my office keep em well oiled in case theyre ever needed right off we go and dont think of running off now itll be worse for you if you do they marched off across the dark grounds neville kept sniffing harry wondered what their punishment was going to be it must be something really horrible or filch wouldnt be sounding so delighted the moon was bright but clouds scudding across it kept throwing them into darkness ahead harry could see the lighted windows of hagrids hut then they heard a distant shout is that you filch hurry up i want ter get started harrys heart rose if they were going to be working with hagrid it wouldnt be so bad his relief must have showed in his face because filch said i suppose you think youll be enjoying yourself with that oaf well think again boy  its into the forest youre going and im much mistaken if youll all come out in one piece at this neville let out a little moan and malfoy stopped dead in his tracks the forest he repeated and he didnt sound quite as cool as usual we cant go in there at night  theres all sorts of things in there  werewolves i heard neville clutched the sleeve of harrys robe and made a choking noise thats your problem isnt it said filch his voice cracking with glee shouldve thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble shouldnt you hagrid came striding toward them out of the dark fang at his heel he was carrying his large crossbow and a quiver of arrows hung over his shoulder abou time he said i bin waitin fer half an hour already all right harry hermione i shouldnt be too friendly to them hagrid said filch coldly theyre here to be punished after all thats why yer late is it said hagrid frowning at filch bin lecturin them eh snot your place ter do that yehve done yer bit ill take over from here ill be back at dawn said filch for whats left of them he added nastily and he turned and started back toward the castle his lamp bobbing away in the darkness malfoy now turned to hagrid im not going in that forest he said and harry was pleased to hear the note of panic in his voice yeh are if yeh want ter stay at hogwarts said hagrid fiercely yehve done wrong an now yehve got ter pay fer it but this is servant stuff its not for students to do i thought wed be copying lines or something if my father knew i was doing this hed tell yer thats how it is at hogwarts hagrid growled copyin lines what goods that ter anyone yehll do summat useful or yehll get out if yeh think yer fatherd rather you were expelled then get back off ter the castle an pack go on malfoy didnt move he looked at hagrid furiously but then dropped his gaze right then said hagrid now listen carefully cause its dangerous what were gonna do tonight an i don want no one takin risks follow me over here a moment he led them to the very edge of the forest holding his lamp up high he pointed down a narrow winding earth track that disappeared into the thick black trees a light breeze lifted their hair as they looked into the forest look there said hagrid see that stuff shinin on the ground silvery stuff thats unicorn blood theres a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat this is the second time in a week i found one dead last wednesday were gonna try an find the poor thing we might have ter put it out of its misery and what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first said malfoy unable to keep the fear out of his voice theres nothin that lives in the forest thatll hurt yeh if yer with me or fang said hagrid an keep ter the path right now were gonna split inter two parties an follow the trail in diffrent directions theres blood all over the place it mustve bin staggerin around since last night at least i want fang said malfoy quickly looking at fangs long teeth all right but i warn yeh hes a coward said hagrid  so me harry an hermionell go one way an draco neville an fangll go the other now if any of us finds the unicorn well send up green sparks right get yer wands out an practice now  thats it  an if anyone gets in trouble send up red sparks an well all come an find yeh  so be careful  lets go the forest was black and silent a little way into it they reached a fork in the earth path and harry hermione and hagrid took the left path while malfoy neville and fang took the right they walked in silence their eyes on the ground every now and then a ray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of silverblue blood on the fallen leaves harry saw that hagrid looked very worried could a werewolf be killing the unicorns harry asked not fast enough said hagrid its not easy ter catch a unicorn theyre powerful magic creatures i never knew one ter be hurt before they walked past a mossy tree stump harry could hear running water there must be a stream somewhere close by there were still spots of unicorn blood here and there along the winding path you all right hermione hagrid whispered don worry it cantve gone far if its this badly hurt an then well be able ter  get behind that tree hagrid seized harry and hermione and hoisted them off the path behind a towering oak he pulled out an arrow and fitted it into his crossbow raising it ready to fire the three of them listened something was slithering over dead leaves nearby it sounded like a cloak trailing along the ground hagrid was squinting up the dark path but after a few seconds the sound faded away i knew it  he murmured theres summat in here that shouldn be a werewolf harry suggested that wasn no werewolf an it wasn no unicorn neither said hagrid grimly right follow me but careful now they walked more slowly ears straining for the faintest sound suddenly in a clearing ahead something definitely moved whos there hagrid called show yerself  im armed and into the clearing came  was it a man or a horse to the waist a man with red hair and beard but below that was a horses gleaming chestnut body with a long reddish tail harry and hermiones jaws dropped oh its you ronan said hagrid in relief how are yeh he walked forward and shook the centaurs hand good evening to you hagrid said ronan he had a deep sorrowful voice were you going to shoot me cant be too careful ronan said hagrid patting his crossbow theres summat bad loose in this forest this is harry potter an hermione granger by the way students up at the school an this is ronan you two hes a centaur wed noticed said hermione faintly good evening said ronan students are you and do you learn much up at the school erm  a bit said hermione timidly a bit well thats something ronan sighed he flung back his head and stared at the sky mars is bright tonight yeah said hagrid glancing up too listen im glad weve run inter yeh ronan cause theres a unicorn bin hurt  you seen anythin ronan didnt answer immediately he stared unblinkingly upward then sighed again always the innocent are the first victims he said so it has been for ages past so it is now yeah said hagrid but have yeh seen anythin ronan anythin unusual mars is bright tonight ronan repeated while hagrid watched him impatiently unusually bright yeah but i was meanin anythin unusual a bit nearer home said hagrid so yeh havent noticed anythin strange yet again ronan took a while to answer at last he said the forest hides many secrets a movement in the trees behind ronan made hagrid raise his bow again but it was only a second centaur blackhaired and bodied and wilderlooking than ronan hullo bane said hagrid all right good evening hagrid i hope you are well well enough look ive jus bin askin ronan you seen anythin odd in here lately theres a unicorn bin injured  would yeh know anythin about it bane walked over to stand next to ronan he looked skyward mars is bright tonight he said simply weve heard said hagrid grumpily well if either of you do see anythin let me know wont yeh well be off then harry and hermione followed him out of the clearing staring over their shoulders at ronan and bane until the trees blocked their view never said hagrid irritably try an get a straight answer out of a centaur ruddy stargazers not interested in anythin closern the moon are there many of them in here asked hermione oh a fair few keep themselves to themselves mostly but theyre good enough about turnin up if ever i want a word theyre deep mind centaurs they know things jus don let on much dyou think that was a centaur we heard earlier said harry did that sound like hooves to you nah if yeh ask me that was whats bin killin the unicorns  never heard anythin like it before they walked on through the dense dark trees harry kept looking nervously over his shoulder he had the nasty feeling they were being watched he was very glad they had hagrid and his crossbow with them they had just passed a bend in the path when hermione grabbed hagrids arm hagrid look red sparks the others are in trouble you two wait here hagrid shouted stay on the path ill come back for yeh they heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood looking at each other very scared until they couldnt hear anything but the rustling of leaves around them you dont think theyve been hurt do you whispered hermione i dont care if malfoy has but if somethings got neville its our fault hes here in the first place the minutes dragged by their ears seemed sharper than usual harrys seemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind every cracking twig what was going on where were the others at last a great crunching noise announced hagrids return malfoy neville and fang were with him hagrid was fuming malfoy it seemed had sneaked up behind neville and grabbed him as a joke neville had panicked and sent up the sparks well be lucky ter catch anythin now with the racket you two were makin right were changin groups  neville you stay with me an hermione harry you go with fang an this idiot im sorry hagrid added in a whisper to harry but hell have a harder time frightenin you an weve gotta get this done so harry set off into the heart of the forest with malfoy and fang they walked for nearly half an hour deeper and deeper into the forest until the path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so thick harry thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker there were splashes on the roots of a tree as though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close by harry could see a clearing ahead through the tangled branches of an ancient oak look  he murmured holding out his arm to stop malfoy something bright white was gleaming on the ground they inched closer it was the unicorn all right and it was dead harry had never seen anything so beautiful and sad its long slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearlywhite on the dark leaves harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him freeze where he stood a bush on the edge of the clearing quivered then out of the shadows a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some stalking beast harry malfoy and fang stood transfixed the cloaked figure reached the unicorn lowered its head over the wound in the animals side and began to drink its blood aaaaaaaaaargh malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted  so did fang the hooded figure raised its head and looked right at harry  unicorn blood was dribbling down its front it got to its feet and came swiftly toward harry  he couldnt move for fear then a pain like hed never felt before pierced his head it was as though his scar were on fire half blinded he staggered backward he heard hooves behind him galloping and something jumped clean over harry charging at the figure the pain in harrys head was so bad he fell to his knees it took a minute or two to pass when he looked up the figure had gone a centaur was standing over him not ronan or bane this one looked younger he had whiteblond hair and a palomino body are you all right said the centaur pulling harry to his feet yes  thank you  what was that the centaur didnt answer he had astonishingly blue eyes like pale sapphires he looked carefully at harry his eyes lingering on the scar that stood out livid on harrys forehead you are the potter boy he said you had better get back to hagrid the forest is not safe at this time  especially for you can you ride it will be quicker this way my name is firenze he added as he lowered himself on to his front legs so that harry could clamber onto his back there was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the clearing ronan and bane came bursting through the trees their flanks heaving and sweaty firenze bane thundered what are you doing you have a human on your back have you no shame are you a common mule do you realize who this is said firenze this is the potter boy the quicker he leaves this forest the better what have you been telling him growled bane remember firenze we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens have we not read what is to come in the movements of the planets ronan pawed the ground nervously im sure firenze thought he was acting for the best  he said in his gloomy voice bane kicked his back legs in anger for the best what is that to do with us centaurs are concerned with what has been foretold it is not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forest firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger so that harry had to grab his shoulders to stay on do you not see that unicorn firenze bellowed at bane do you not understand why it was killed or have the planets not let you in on that secret i set myself against what is lurking in this forest bane yes with humans alongside me if i must and firenze whisked around with harry clutching on as best he could they plunged off into the trees leaving ronan and bane behind them harry didnt have a clue what was going on whys bane so angry he asked what was that thing you saved me from anyway firenze slowed to a walk warned harry to keep his head bowed in case of lowhanging branches but did not answer harrys question they made their way through the trees in silence for so long that harry thought firenze didnt want to talk to him anymore they were passing through a particularly dense patch of trees however when firenze suddenly stopped harry potter do you know what unicorn blood is used for no said harry startled by the odd question weve only used the horn and tail hair in potions that is because it is a monstrous thing to slay a unicorn said firenze only one who has nothing to lose and everything to gain would commit such a crime the blood of a unicorn will keep you alive even if you are an inch from death but at a terrible price you have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself and you will have but a halflife a cursed life from the moment the blood touches your lips harry stared at the back of firenzes head which was dappled silver in the moonlight but whod be that desperate he wondered aloud if youre going to be cursed forever deaths better isnt it it is firenze agreed unless all you need is to stay alive long enough to drink something else  something that will bring you back to full strength and power  something that will mean you can never die mr potter do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment the sorcerers stone of course  the elixir of life but i dont understand who  can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power who has clung to life awaiting their chance it was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around harrys heart over the rustling of the trees he seemed to hear once more what hagrid had told him on the night they had met some say he died codswallop in my opinion dunno if he had enough human left in him to die do you mean harry croaked that was vol harry harry are you all right hermione was running toward them down the path hagrid puffing along behind her im fine said harry hardly knowing what he was saying the unicorns dead hagrid its in that clearing back there this is where i leave you firenze murmured as hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn you are safe now harry slid off his back good luck harry potter said firenze the planets have been read wrongly before now even by centaurs i hope this is one of those times he turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest leaving harry shivering behind him ron had fallen asleep in the dark common room waiting for them to return he shouted something about quidditch fouls when harry roughly shook him awake in a matter of seconds though he was wideeyed as harry began to tell him and hermione what had happened in the forest harry couldnt sit down he paced up and down in front of the fire he was still shaking snape wants the stone for voldemort and voldemorts waiting in the forest and all this time we thought snape just wanted to get rich stop saying the name said ron in a terrified whisper as if he thought voldemort could hear them harry wasnt listening firenze saved me but he shouldnt have done so bane was furious he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to happen they must show that voldemorts coming back bane thinks firenze should have let voldemort kill me i suppose thats written in the stars as well will you stop saying the name ron hissed so all ive got to wait for now is snape to steal the stone harry went on feverishly then voldemort will be able to come and finish me off well i suppose banell be happy hermione looked very frightened but she had a word of comfort harry everyone says dumbledores the only one youknowwho was ever afraid of with dumbledore around youknowwho wont touch you anyway who says the centaurs are right it sounds like fortunetelling to me and professor mcgonagall says thats a very imprecise branch of magic the sky had turned light before they stopped talking they went to bed exhausted their throats sore but the nights surprises werent over when harry pulled back his sheets he found his invisibility cloak folded neatly underneath them there was a note pinned to it just in case chapter sixteen through the trapdoor in years to come harry would never quite remember how he had managed to get through his exams when he half expected voldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment yet the days crept by and there could be no doubt that fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door it was sweltering hot especially in the large classroom where they did their written papers they had been given special new quills for the exams which had been bewitched with an anticheating spell they had practical exams as well professor flitwick called them one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tapdance across a desk professor mcgonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox  points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was but taken away if it had whiskers snape made them all nervous breathing down their necks while they tried to remember how to make a forgetfulness potion harry did the best he could trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his forehead which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest neville thought harry had a bad case of exam nerves because harry couldnt sleep but the truth was that harry kept being woken by his old nightmare except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in it maybe it was because they hadnt seen what harry had seen in the forest or because they didnt have scars burning on their foreheads but ron and hermione didnt seem as worried about the stone as harry the idea of voldemort certainly scared them but he didnt keep visiting them in dreams and they were so busy with their studying they didnt have much time to fret about what snape or anyone else might be up to their very last exam was history of magic one hour of answering questions about batty old wizards whod invented selfstirring cauldrons and theyd be free free for a whole wonderful week until their exam results came out when the ghost of professor binns told them to put down their quills and roll up their parchment harry couldnt help cheering with the rest that was far easier than i thought it would be said hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds i neednt have learned about the 1637 werewolf code of conduct or the uprising of elfric the eager hermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward but ron said this made him feel ill so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under a tree the weasley twins and lee jordan were tickling the tentacles of a giant squid which was basking in the warm shallows no more studying ron sighed happily stretching out on the grass you could look more cheerful harry weve got a week before we find out how badly weve done theres no need to worry yet harry was rubbing his forehead i wish i knew what this means he burst out angrily my scar keeps hurting  its happened before but never as often as this go to madam pomfrey hermione suggested im not ill said harry i think its a warning it means dangers coming ron couldnt get worked up it was too hot harry relax hermiones right the stones safe as long as dumbledores around anyway weve never had any proof snape found out how to get past fluffy he nearly had his leg ripped off once hes not going to try it again in a hurry and neville will play quidditch for england before hagrid lets dumbledore down harry nodded but he couldnt shake off a lurking feeling that there was something hed forgotten to do something important when he tried to explain this hermione said thats just the exams i woke up last night and was halfway through my transfiguration notes before i remembered wed done that one harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didnt have anything to do with work though he watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky a note clamped in its mouth hagrid was the only one who ever sent him letters hagrid would never betray dumbledore hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past fluffy never but  harry suddenly jumped to his feet wherere you going said ron sleepily ive just thought of something said harry he had turned white weve got to go and see hagrid now why panted hermione hurrying to keep up dont you think its a bit odd said harry scrambling up the grassy slope that what hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket how many people wander around with dragon eggs if its against wizard law lucky they found hagrid dont you think why didnt i see it before what are you talking about said ron but harry sprinting across the grounds toward the forest didnt answer hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house his trousers and sleeves were rolled up and he was shelling peas into a large bowl hullo he said smiling finished yer exams got time fer a drink yes please said ron but harry cut him off no were in a hurry hagrid ive got to ask you something you know that night you won norbert what did the stranger you were playing cards with look like dunno said hagrid casually he wouldn take his cloak off he saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows its not that unusual yeh get a lot o funny folk in the hogs head  thats the pub down in the village mighta bin a dragon dealer mightn he i never saw his face he kept his hood up harry sank down next to the bowl of peas what did you talk to him about hagrid did you mention hogwarts at all mighta come up said hagrid frowning as he tried to remember yeah he asked what i did an i told him i was gamekeeper here he asked a bit about the sorta creatures i took after so i told him an i said what id always really wanted was a dragon an then i can remember too well cause he kept buyin me drinks lets see yeah then he said he had the dragon egg an we could play cards fer it if i wanted but he had ter be sure i could handle it he didn want it ter go ter any old home so i told him after fluffy a dragon would be easy and did he  did he seem interested in fluffy harry asked try ing to keep his voice calm well  yeah  how many threeheaded dogs dyeh meet even around hogwarts so i told him fluffys a piece o cake if yeh know how to calm him down jus play him a bit o music an hell go straight off ter sleep  hagrid suddenly looked horrified i shouldnta told yeh that he blurted out forget i said it hey  wherere yeh goin harry ron and hermione didnt speak to each other at all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall which seemed very cold and gloomy after the grounds weve got to go to dumbledore said harry hagrid told that stranger how to get past fluffy and it was either snape or voldemort under that cloak  it mustve been easy once hed got hagrid drunk i just hope dumbledore believes us firenze might back us up if bane doesnt stop him wheres dumbledores office they looked around as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the right direction they had never been told where dumbledore lived nor did they know anyone who had been sent to see him well just have to  harry began but a voice suddenly rang across the hall what are you three doing inside it was professor mcgonagall carrying a large pile of books we want to see professor dumbledore said hermione rather bravely harry and ron thought see professor dumbledore professor mcgonagall repeated as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do why harry swallowed  now what its sort of secret he said but he wished at once he hadnt because professor mcgonagalls nostrils flared professor dumbledore left ten minutes ago she said coldly he received an urgent owl from the ministry of magic and flew off for london at once hes gone said harry frantically now professor dumbledore is a very great wizard potter he has many demands on his time  but this is important something you have to say is more important than the ministry of magic potter look said harry throwing caution to the winds professor  its about the sorcerers tone  whatever professor mcgonagall had expected it wasnt that the books she was carrying tumbled out of her arms but she didnt pick them up how do you know  she spluttered professor i think  i know  that sn that someones going to try and steal the stone ive got to talk to professor dumbledore she eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion professor dumbledore will be back tomorrow she said finally i dont know how you found out about the stone but rest assured no one can possibly steal it its too well protected but professor  potter i know what im talking about she said shortly she bent down and gathered up the fallen books i suggest you all go back outside and enjoy the sunshine but they didnt its tonight said harry once he was sure professor mcgonagall was out of earshot snapes going through the trapdoor tonight hes found out everything he needs and now hes got dumbledore out of the way he sent that note i bet the ministry of magic will get a real shock when dumbledore turns up but what can we  hermione gasped harry and ron wheeled round snape was standing there good afternoon he said smoothly they stared at him you shouldnt be inside on a day like this he said with an odd twisted smile we were  harry began without any idea what he was going to say you want to be more careful said snape hanging around like this people will think youre up to something and gryffindor really cant afford to lose any more points can it harry flushed they turned to go outside but snape called them back be warned potter  any more nighttime wanderings and i will personally make sure you are expelled good day to you he strode off in the direction of the staffroom out on the stone steps harry turned to the others right heres what weve got to do he whispered urgently one of us has got to keep an eye on snape  wait outside the staff room and follow him if he leaves it hermione youd better do that why me its obvious said ron you can pretend to be waiting for professor flitwick you know he put on a high voice oh professor flitwick im so worried i think i got question fourteen b wrong oh shut up said hermione but she agreed to go and watch out for snape and wed better stay outside the thirdfloor corridor harry told ron come on but that part of the plan didnt work no sooner had they reached the door separating fluffy from the rest of the school than professor mcgonagall turned up again and this time she lost her temper i suppose you think youre harder to get past than a pack of enchantments she stormed enough of this nonsense if i hear you ve come anywhere near here again ill take another fifty points from gryffindor yes weasley from my own house harry and ron went back to the common room harry had just said at least hermiones on snapes tail when the portrait of the fat lady swung open and hermione came in im sorry harry she wailed snape came out and asked me what i was doing so i said i was waiting for flitwick and snape went to get him and ive only just got away i dont know where snape went well thats it then isnt it harry said the other two stared at him he was pale and his eyes were glittering im going out of here tonight and im going to try and get to the stone first youre mad said ron you cant said hermione after what mcgonagall and snape have said youll be expelled so whap harry shouted dont you understand if snape gets hold of the stone voldemorts coming back havent you heard what it was like when he was trying to take over there wont be any hogwarts to get expelled from hell flatten it or turn it into a school for the dark arts losing points doesnt matter anymore cant you see dyou think hell leave you and your families alone if gryffindor wins the house cup if i get caught before i can get to the stone well ill have to go back to the dursleys and wait for voldemort to find me there its only dying a bit later than i would have because im never going over to the dark side im going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me voldemort killed my parents remember he glared at them youre right harry said hermione in a small voice ill use the invisibility cloak said harry its just lucky i got it back but will it cover all three of us said ron all  all three of us oh come off it you dont think wed let you go alone of course not said hermione briskly how do you think youd get to the stone without us id better go and took through my books there might be something useful but if we get caught you two will be expelled too not if i can help it said hermione grimly flitwick told me in secret that i got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam theyre not throwing me out after that after dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room nobody bothered them none of the gryffindors had anything to say to harry any more after all this was the first night he hadnt been upset by it hermione was skimming through all her notes hoping to come across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break harry and ron didnt talk much both of them were thinking about what they were about to do slowly the room emptied as people drifted off to bed better get the cloak ron muttered as lee jordan finally left stretching and yawning harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory he putted out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute hagrid had given him for christmas he pocketed it to use on fluffy  he didnt feel much like singing he ran back down to the common room wed better put the cloak on here and make sure it covers all three of us  if filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own  what are you doing said a voice from the corner of the room neville appeared from behind an armchair clutching trevor the toad who looked as though hed been making another bid for freedom nothing neville nothing said harry hurriedly putting the cloak behind his back neville stared at their guilty faces youre going out again he said no no no said hermione no were not why dont you go to bed neville harry looked at the grandfather clock by the door they couldnt afford to waste any more time snape might even now be playing fluffy to sleep you cant go out said neville youll be caught again gryffindor will be in even more trouble you dont understand said harry this is important but neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate i wont let you do it he said hurrying to stand in front of the portrait hole ill  ill fight you neville ron exploded get away from that hole and dont be an idiot  dont you call me an idiot said neville i dont think you should be breaking any more rules and you were the one who told me to stand up to people yes but not to us said ron in exasperation neville you dont know what youre doing he took a step forward and neville dropped trevor the toad who leapt out of sight go on then try and hit me said neville raising his fists im ready harry turned to hermione do something he said desperately hermione stepped forward neville she said im really really sorry about this she raised her wand petrificus totalus she cried pointing it at neville nevilles arms snapped to his sides his legs sprang together his whole body rigid he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face stiff as a board hermione ran to turn him over nevilles jaws were jammed together so he couldnt speak only his eyes were moving looking at them in horror whatve you done to him harry whispered its the full bodybind said hermione miserably oh neville im so sorry we had to neville no time to explain said harry youll understand later neville said ron as they stepped over him and pulled on the invisibility cloak but leaving neville lying motionless on the floor didnt feel like a very good omen in their nervous state every statues shadow looked like filch every distant breath of wind sounded like peeves swooping down on them at the foot of the first set of stairs they spotted mrs norris skulking near the top oh lets kick her just this once ron whispered in harrys ear but harry shook his head as they climbed carefully around her mrs norris turned her lamplike eyes on them but didnt do anything they didnt meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the third floor peeves was bobbing halfway up loosening the carpet so that people would trip whos there he said suddenly as they climbed toward him he narrowed his wicked black eyes know youre there even if i cant see you are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie he rose up in the air and floated there squinting at them should call filch i should if somethings acreeping around unseen harry had a sudden idea peeves he said in a hoarse whisper the bloody baron has his own reasons for being invisible peeves almost fell out of the air in shock he caught himself in time and hovered about a foot off the stairs so sorry your bloodiness mr baron sir he said greasily my mistake my mistake  i didnt see you  of course i didnt youre invisible  forgive old peevsie his little joke sir i have business here peeves croaked harry stay away from this place tonight i will sir i most certainly will said peeves rising up in the air again hope your business goes well baron ill not bother you and he scooted off brilliant harry whispered ron a few seconds later they were there outside the thirdfloor corridor  and the door was already ajar well there you are harry said quietly snapes already got past fluffy seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them what was facing them underneath the cloak harry turned to the other two if you want to go back i wont blame you he said you can take the cloak i wont need it now dont be stupid said ron were coming said hermione harry pushed the door open as the door creaked low rumbling growls met their ears all three of the dogs noses sniffed madly in their direction even though it couldnt see them whats that at its feet hermione whispered looks like a harp said ron snape must have left it there it must wake up the moment you stop playing said harry well here goes he put hagrids flute to his lips and blew it wasnt really a tune but from the first note the beasts eyes began to droop harry hardly drew breath slowly the dogs growls ceased  it tottered on its paws and fell to its knees then it slumped to the ground fast asleep keep playing ron warned harry as they slipped out of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor they could feel the dogs hot smelly breath as they approached the giant heads i think well be able to pull the door open said ron peering over the dogs back want to go first hermione no i dont all right ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dogs legs he bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor which swung up and open what can you see hermione said anxiously nothing  just black  theres no way of climbing down well just have to drop harry who was still playing the flute waved at ron to get his attention and pointed at himself you want to go first are you sure said ron i dont know how deep this thing goes give the flute to hermione so she can keep him asleep harry handed the flute over in the few seconds silence the dog growled and twitched but the moment hermione began to play it fell back into its deep sleep harry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor there was no sign of the bottom he lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his fingertips then he looked up at ron and said if anything happens to me dont follow go straight to the owlery and send hedwig to dumbledore right right said ron see you in a minute i hope and harry let go cold damp air rushed past him as he fell down down down and  flump with a funny muffled sort of thump he landed on something soft he sat up and felt around his eyes not used to the gloom it felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant its okay he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp which was the open trapdoor its a soft landing you can jump ron followed right away he landed sprawled next to harry whats this stuff were his first words dunno some sort of plant thing i suppose its here to break the fall come on hermione the distant music stopped there was a loud bark from the dog but hermione had already jumped she landed on harrys other side we must be miles under the school  she said lucky this plant things here really said ron lucky shrieked hermione look at you both she leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall she had to struggle because the moment she had landed the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils around her ankles as for harry and ron their legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on her now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off them but the more they strained against it the tighter and faster the plant wound around them stop moving hermione ordered them i know what this is  its devils snare oh im so glad we know what its called thats a great help snarled ron leaning back trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck shut up im trying to remember how to kill it said hermione well hurry up i cant breathe harry gasped wrestling with it as it curled around his chest devils snare devils snare what did professor sprout say  it likes the dark and the damp so light a fire harry choked yes  of course  but theres no wood hermione cried wringing her hands have you gone mad ron bellowed are you a witch or not oh right said hermione and she whipped out her wand waved it muttered something and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had used on sna
