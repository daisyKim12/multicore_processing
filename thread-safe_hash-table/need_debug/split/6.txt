d onto his nimbus two thousand madam hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle fifteen brooms rose up high high into the air they were off and the quaffle is taken immediately by angelina johnson of gryffindor  what an excellent chaser that girl is and rather attractive too  jordan sorry professor the weasley twins friend lee jordan was doing the commentary for the match closely watched by professor mcgonagall and shes really belting along up there a neat pass to alicia spinnet a good find of oliver woods last year only a reserve  back to johnson and  no the slytherins have taken the quaffle slytherin captain marcus flint gains the quaffle and off he goes  flint flying like an eagle up there  hes going to sc no stopped by an excellent move by gryffindor keeper wood and the gryffindors take the quaffle  thats chaser katie bell of gryffindor there nice dive around flint off up the field and  ouch  that must have hurt hit in the back of the head by a bludger  quaffle taken

bletchley dives  misses  gryffindors score gryffindor cheers filled the cold air with howls and moans from the slytherins budge up there move along hagrid ron and hermione squeezed together to give hagrid enough space to join them bin watchin from me hut said hagrid patting a large pair of binoculars around his neck but it isnt the same as bein in the crowd no sign of the snitch yet eh nope said ron harry hasnt had much to do yet kept outta trouble though thats somethin said hagrid raising his binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was harry way up above them harry was gliding over the game squinting about for some sign of the snitch this was part of his and woods game plan keep out of the way until you catch sight of the snitch wood had said we dont want you attacked before you have to be when angelina had scored harry had done a couple of looptheloops to let off his feelings now he was back to staring around for the snitch once he caught sight of a flash of gold but it was just a reflection from one of the weasleys wristwatches and once a bludger decided to come pelting his way more like a cannonball than anything but harry dodged it and fred weasley came chasing after it all right there harry he had time to yell as he beat the bludger furiously toward marcus flint slytherin in possession lee jordan was saying chaser pucey ducks two bludgers two weasleys and chaser bell and speeds toward the  wait a moment  was that the snitch a murmur ran through the crowd as adrian pucey dropped the quaffle too busy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his left ear harry saw it in a great rush of excitement he dived downward after the streak of gold slytherin seeker terence higgs had seen it too neck and neck they hurtled toward the snitch all the chasers seemed to have forgotten what they were supposed to be doing as they hung in midair to watch harry was faster than higgs  he could see the little round ball wings fluttering darting up ahead   he put on an extra spurt of speed  wham a roar of rage echoed from the gryffindors below  marcus flint had blocked harry on purpose and harrys broom spun off course harry holding on for dear life foul screamed the gryffindors madam hooch spoke angrily to flint and then ordered a free shot at the goal posts for gryffindor but in all the confusion of course the golden snitch had disappeared from sight again down in the stands dean thomas was yelling send him off ref red card what are you talking about dean said ron red card said dean furiously in soccer you get shown the red card and youre out of the game but this isnt soccer dean ron reminded him hagrid however was on deans side they oughta change the rules flint coulda knocked harry outta the air lee jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides so  after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating jordan growled professor mcgonagall i mean after that open and revolting foul jordan im warning you  all right all right flint nearly kills the gryffindor seeker which could happen to anyone im sure so a penalty to gryffindor taken by spinner who puts it away no trouble and we continue play gryffindor still in possession it was as harry dodged another bludger which went spinning dangerously past his head that it happened his broom gave a sudden frightening lurch for a split second he thought he was going to fall he gripped the broom tightly with both his hands and knees hed never felt anything like that it happened again it was as though the broom was trying to buck him off but nimbus two thousands did not suddenly decide to buck their riders off harry tried to turn back toward the gryffindor goal posts  he had half a mind to ask wood to call timeout  and then he realized that his broom was completely out of his control he couldnt turn it he couldnt direct it at all it was zigzagging through the air and every now and then making violent swishing movements that almost unseated him lee was still commentating slytherin in possession  flint with the quaffle  passes spinnet  passes bell  hit hard in the face by a bludger hope it broke his nose  only joking professor  slytherins score  a no the slytherins were cheering no one seemed to have noticed that harrys broom was behaving strangely it was carrying him slowly higher away from the game jerking and twitching as it went dunno what harry thinks hes doing hagrid mumbled he stared through his binoculars if i didn know better id say hed lost control of his broom but he cant have suddenly people were pointing up at harry all over the stands his broom had started to roll over and over with him only just managing to hold on then the whole crowd gasped harrys broom had given a wild jerk and harry swung off it he was now dangling from it holding on with only one hand did something happen to it when flint blocked him seamus whispered cant have hagrid said his voice shaking cant nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful dark magic  no kid could do that to a nimbus two thousand at these words hermione seized hagrids binoculars but instead of looking up at harry she started looking frantically at the crowd what are you doing moaned ron grayfaced i knew it hermione gasped snape  look ron grabbed the binoculars snape was in the middle of the stands opposite them he had his eyes fixed on harry and was muttering nonstop under his breath hes doing something  jinxing the broom said hermione what should we do leave it to me before ron could say another word hermione had disappeared ron turned the binoculars back on harry his broom was vibrating so hard it was almost impossible for him to hang on much longer the whole crowd was on its feet watching terrified as the weasleys flew up to try and pull harry safely onto one of their brooms but it was no good  every time they got near him the broom would jump higher still they dropped lower and circled beneath him obviously hoping to catch him if he fell marcus flint seized the quaffle and scored five times without anyone noticing come on hermione ron muttered desperately hermione had fought her way across to the stand where snape stood and was now racing along the row behind him she didnt even stop to say sorry as she knocked professor quirrell headfirst into the row in front reaching snape she crouched down pulled out her wand and whispered a few well chosen words bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the hem of snapes robes it took perhaps thirty seconds for snape to realize that he was on fire a sudden yelp told her she had done her job scooping the fire off him into a little jar in her pocket she scrambled back along the row  snape would never know what had happened it was enough up in the air harry was suddenly able to clamber back on to his broom neville you can look ron said neville had been sobbing into hagrids jacket for the last five minutes harry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick  he hit the field on all fours  coughed  and something gold fell into his hand ive got the snitch he shouted waving it above his head and the game ended in complete confusion he didnt catch it he nearly swallowed it flint was still howling twenty minutes later but it made no difference  harry hadnt broken any rules and lee jordan was still happily shouting the results  gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty harry heard none of this though he was being made a cup of strong tea back in hagrids hut with ron and hermione it was snape ron was explaining hermione and i saw him he was cursing your broomstick muttering he wouldnt take his eyes off you rubbish said hagrid who hadnt heard a word of what had gone on next to him in the stands why would snape do somethin like that harry ron and hermione looked at one another wondering what to tell him harry decided on the truth i found out something about him he told hagrid he tried to get past that threeheaded dog on halloween it bit him we think he was trying to steal whatever its guarding hagrid dropped the teapot how do you know about fluffy he said fluffy yeah  hes mine  bought him off a greek chappie i met in the pub las year  i lent him to dumbledore to guard the yes said harry eagerly now dont ask me anymore said hagrid gruffly thats top secret that is but snapes trying to steal it rubbish said hagrid again snapes a hogwarts teacher hed do nothin of the sort so why did he just try and kill harry cried hermione the afternoons events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about snape i know a jinx when i see one hagrid ive read all about them youve got to keep eye contact and snape wasnt blinking at all i saw him im tellin yeh yer wrong said hagrid hotly i don know why harrys broom acted like that but snape wouldn try an kill a student now listen to me all three of yeh  yer meddlin in things that don concern yeh its dangerous you forget that dog an you forget what its guardin thats between professor dumbledore an nicolas flamel  aha said harry so theres someone called nicolas flamel involved is there hagrid looked furious with himself chapter twelve the mirror of erised christmas was coming one morning in middecember hogwarts woke to find itself covered in several feet of snow the lake froze solid and the weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they followed quirrell around bouncing off the back of his turban the few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by hagrid before they could fly off again no one could wait for the holidays to start while the gryffindor common room and the great hall had roaring fires the drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms worst of all were professor snapes classes down in the dungeons where their breath rose in a mist before them and they kept as close as possible to their hot cauldrons i do feel so sorry said draco malfoy one potions class for all those people who have to stay at hogwarts for christmas because theyre not wanted at home he was looking over at harry as he spoke crabbe and goyle chuckled harry who was measuring out powdered spine of lionfish ignored them malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the quidditch match disgusted that the slytherins had lost he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a widemouthed tree frog would be replacing harry as seeker next then hed realized that nobody found this funny because they were all so impressed at the way harry had managed to stay on his bucking broomstick so malfoy jealous and angry had gone back to taunting harry about having no proper family it was true that harry wasnt going back to privet drive for christmas professor mcgonagall had come around the week before making a list of students who would be staying for the holidays and harry had signed up at once he didnt feel sorry for himself at all this would probably be the best christmas hed ever had ron and his brothers were staying too because mr and mrs weasley were going to romania to visit charlie when they left the dungeons at the end of potions they found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that hagrid was behind it hi hagrid want any help ron asked sticking his head through the branches nah im all right thanks ron would you mind moving out of the way came malfoys cold drawl from behind them are you trying to earn some extra money weasley hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave hogwarts i suppose  that hut of hagrids must seem like a palace compared to what your familys used to ron dived at malfoy just as snape came up the stairs weasley ron let go of the front of malfoys robes he was provoked professor snape said hagrid sticking his huge hairy face out from behind the tree malfoy was insultin his family be that as it may fighting is against hogwarts rules hagrid said snape silkily five points from gryffindor weasley and be grateful it isnt more move along all of you malfoy crabbe and goyle pushed roughly past the tree scattering needles everywhere and smirking ill get him said ron grinding his teeth at malfoys back one of these days ill get him  i hate them both said harry malfoy and snape come on cheer up its nearly christmas said hagrid tell yeh what come with me an see the great hall looks a treat so the three of them followed hagrid and his tree off to the great hall where professor mcgonagall and professor flitwick were busy with the christmas decorations ah hagrid the last tree  put it in the far corner would you the hall looked spectacular festoons of holly and mistletoe hung all around the walls and no less than twelve towering christmas trees stood around the room some sparkling with tiny icicles some glittering with hundreds of candles how many days you got left until yer holidays hagrid asked just one said hermione and that reminds me harry ron weve got half an hour before lunch we should be in the library oh yeah youre right said ron tearing his eyes away from professor flitwick who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing them over the branches of the new tree the library said hagrid following them out of the hall just before the holidays bit keen arent yeh oh were not working harry told him brightly ever since you mentioned nicolas flamel weve been trying to find out who he is you what hagrid looked shocked listen here  ive told yeh  drop it its nothin to you what that dogs guardin we just want to know who nicolas flamel is thats all said hermione unless youd like to tell us and save us the trouble harry added we mustve been through hundreds of books already and we cant find him anywhere  just give us a hint  i know ive read his name somewhere im sayin nothin said hagrid flatly just have to find out for ourselves then said ron and they left hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library they had indeed been searching books for flamels name ever since hagrid had let it slip because how else were they going to find out what snape was trying to steal the trouble was it was very hard to know where to begin not knowing what flamel might have done to get himself into a book he wasnt in great wizards of the twentieth century or notable magical names of our time he was missing too from important modern magical discoveries and a study of recent developments in wizardry and then of course there was the sheer size of the library tens of thousands of books thousands of shelves hundreds of narrow rows hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to search while ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off the shelves at random harry wandered over to the restricted section he had been wondering for a while if flamel wasnt somewhere in there unfortunately you needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the restricted books and he knew hed never get one these were the books containing powerful dark magic never taught at hogwarts and only read by older students studying advanced defense against the dark arts what are you looking for boy nothing said harry madam pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him youd better get out then go on  out wishing hed been a bit quicker at thinking up some story harry left the library he ron and hermione had already agreed theyd better not ask madam pince where they could find flamel they were sure shed be able to tell them but they couldnt risk snape hearing what they were up to harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found anything but he wasnt very hopeful they had been looking for two weeks after a but as they only had odd moments between lessons it wasnt surprising theyd found nothing what they really needed was a nice long search without madam pince breathing down their necks five minutes later ron and hermione joined him shaking their heads they went off to lunch you will keep looking while im away wont you said hermione and send me an owl if you find anything and you could ask your parents if they know who flamel is said ron itd be safe to ask them very safe as theyre both dentists said hermione once the holidays had started ron and harry were having too good a time to think much about flamel they had the dormitory to themselves and the common room was far emptier than usual so they were able to get the good armchairs by the fire they sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a toasting fork  bread english muffins marshmallows  and plotting ways of getting malfoy expelled which were fun to talk about even if they wouldnt work ron also started teaching harry wizard chess this was exactly like muggle chess except that the figures were alive which made it a lot like directing troops in battle rons set was very old and battered like everything else he owned it had once belonged to someone else in his family  in this case his grandfather however old chessmen werent a drawback at all ron knew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he wanted harry played with chessmen seamus finnigan had lent him and they didnt trust him at all he wasnt a very good player yet and they kept shouting different bits of advice at him which was confusing dont send me there cant you see his knight send him we can afford to lose him on christmas eve harry went to bed looking forward to the next day for the food and the fun but not expecting any presents at all when he woke early in the morning however the first thing he saw was a small pile of packages at the foot of his bed merry christmas said ron sleepily as harry scrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe you too said harry will you look at this ive got some presents what did you expect turnips said ron turning to his own pile which was a lot bigger than harrys harry picked up the top parcel it was wrapped in thick brown paper and scrawled across it was to harry from hagrid inside was a roughly cut wooden flute hagrid had obviously whittled it himself harry blew it  it sounded a bit like an owl a second very small parcel contained a note we received your message and enclose your christmas present from uncle vernon and aunt petunia taped to the note was a fiftypence piece thats friendly said harry ron was fascinated by the fifty pence weird he said nmat a shape this is money you can keep it said harry laughing at how pleased ron was hagrid and my aunt and uncle  so who sent these i think i know who that ones from said ron turning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy parcel my mom i told her you didnt expect any presents and  oh no he groaned shes made you a weasley sweater harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick handknitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge every year she makes us a sweater said ron unwrapping his own and mines always maroon thats really nice of her said harry trying the fudge which was very tasty his next present also contained candy  a large box of chocolate frogs from hermione this only left one parcel harry picked it up and felt it it was very light he unwrapped it something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it lay in gleaming folds ron gasped ive heard of those he said in a hushed voice dropping the box of every flavor beans hed gotten from hermione if thats what i think it is  theyre really rare and really valuable what is it harry picked the shining silvery cloth off the floor it was strange to the touch like water woven into material its an invisibility cloak said ron a look of awe on his face im sure it is  try it on harry threw the cloak around his shoulders and ron gave a yell it is look down harry looked down at his feet but they were gone he dashed to the mirror sure enough his reflection looked back at him just his head suspended in midair his body completely invisible he pulled the cloak over his head and his reflection vanished completely theres a note said ron suddenly a note fell out of it harry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter written in narrow loopy writing he had never seen before were the following words your father left this in my possession before he died it is time it was returned to you use it well a very merry christmas to you there was no signature harry stared at the note ron was admiring the cloak id give anything for one of these he said anything whats the matter nothing said harry he felt very strange who had sent the cloak had it really once belonged to his father before he could say or think anything else the dormitory door was flung open and fred and george weasley bounded in harry stuffed the cloak quickly out of sight he didnt feel like sharing it with anyone else yet merry christmas hey look  harrys got a weasley sweater too fred and george were wearing blue sweaters one with a large yellow f on it the other a g harrys is better than ours though said fred holding up harrys sweater she obviously makes more of an effort if youre not family why arent you wearing yours ron george demanded come on get it on theyre lovely and warm i hate maroon ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his head you havent got a letter on yours george observed i suppose she thinks you dont forget your name but were not stupid  we know were called gred and forge whats all th is noise percy weasley stuck his head through the door looking disapproving he had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as he too carried a lumpy sweater over his arm which fred seized p for prefect get it on percy come on were all wearing ours even harry got one i  dont  want said percy thickly as the twins forced the sweater over his head knocking his glasses askew and youre not sitting with the prefects today either said george christmas is a time for family they frogmarched percy from the room his arms pinned to his side by his sweater harry had never in all his life had such a christmas dinner a hundred fat roast turkeys mountains of roast and boiled potatoes platters of chipolatas tureens of buttered peas silver boats of thick rich gravy and cranberry sauce  and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table these fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble muggle ones the dursleys usually bought with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside harry pulled a wizard cracker with fred and it didnt just bang it went off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke while from the inside exploded a rear admirals hat and several live white mice up at the high table dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizards hat for a flowered bonnet and was chuckling merrily at a joke professor flitwick had just read him flaming christmas puddings followed the turkey percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice harry watched hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine finally kissing professor mcgonagall on the cheek who to harrys amazement giggled and blushed her top hat lopsided when harry finally left the table he was laden down with a stack of things out of the crackers including a pack of nonexplodable luminous balloons a growyourownwarts kit and his own new wizard chess set the white mice had disappeared and harry had a nasty feeling they were going to end up as mrs norriss christmas dinner harry and the weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball fight on the grounds then cold wet and gasping for breath they returned to the fire in the gryffindor common room where harry broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to ron he suspected he wouldnt have lost so badly if percy hadnt tried to help him so much after a meal of turkey sandwiches crumpets trifle and christmas cake everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch percy chase fred and george all over gryffindor tower because theyd stolen his prefect badge it had been harrys best christmas day ever yet something had been nagging at the back of his mind all day not until he climbed into bed was he free to think about it the invisibility cloak and whoever had sent it ron full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him fell asleep almost as soon as hed drawn the curtains of his fourposter harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under it his fathers this had been his fathers he let the material flow over his hands smoother than silk light as air use it well the note had said he had to try it now he slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak around himself looking down at his legs he saw only moonlight and shadows it was a very funny feeling use it well suddenly harry felt wideawake the whole of hogwarts was open to him in this cloak excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the dark and silence he could go anywhere in this anywhere and filch would never know ron grunted in his sleep should harry wake him something held him back  his fathers cloak  he felt that this time  the first time  he wanted to use it alone he crept out of the dormitory down the stairs across the common room and climbed through the portrait hole whos there squawked the fat lady harry said nothing he walked quickly down the corridor where should he go he stopped his heart racing and thought and then it came to him the restricted section in the library hed be able to read as long as he liked as long as it took to find out who flamel was he set off drawing the invisibility cloak tight around him as he walked the library was pitchblack and very eerie harry lit a lamp to see his way along the rows of books the lamp looked as if it was floating along in midair and even though harry could feel his arm supporting it the sight gave him the creeps the restricted section was right at the back of the library step ping carefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the library he held up his lamp to read the titles they didnt tell him much their peeling faded gold letters spelled words in languages harry couldnt understand some had no title at all one book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood the hairs on the back of harrys neck prickled maybe he was imagining it maybe not but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books as though they knew someone was there who shouldnt be he had to start somewhere setting the lamp down carefully on the floor he looked along the bottom shelf for an interestinglooking book a large black and silver volume caught his eye he pulled it out with difficulty because it was very heavy and balancing it on his knee let it fall open a piercing bloodcurdling shriek split the silence  the book was screaming harry snapped it shut but the shriek went on and on one high unbroken earsplitting note he stumbled backward and knocked over his lamp which went out at once panicking he heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside  stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf he ran for it he passed filch in the doorway filchs pale wild eyes looked straight through him and harry slipped under filchs outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor the books shrieks still ringing in his ears he came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor he had been so busy getting away from the library he hadnt paid attention to where he was going perhaps because it was dark he didnt recognize where he was at all there was a suit of armor near the kitchens he knew but he must be five floors above there you asked me to come directly to you professor if anyone was wandering around at night and somebodys been in the library restricted section harry felt the blood drain out of his face wherever he was filch must know a shortcut because his soft greasy voice was getting nearer and to his horror it was snape who replied the restricted section well they cant be far well catch them harry stood rooted to the spot as filch and snape came around the corner ahead they couldnt see him of course but it was a narrow corridor and if they came much nearer theyd knock right into him  the cloak didnt stop him from being solid he backed away as quietly as he could a door stood ajar to his left it was his only hope he squeezed through it holding his breath trying not to move it and to his relief he managed to get inside the room without their noticing anything they walked straight past and harry leaned against the wall breathing deeply listening to their footsteps dying away that had been close very close it was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in it looked like an unused classroom the dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the walls and there was an upturned wastepaper basket  but propped against the wall facing him was something that didnt look as if it belonged there something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the way it was a magnificent mirror as high as the ceiling with an ornate gold frame standing on two clawed feet there was an inscription carved around the top erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi his panic fading now that there was no sound of filch and snape harry moved nearer to the mirror wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again he stepped in front of it he had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming he whirled around his heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed  for he had seen not only himself in the mirror but a whole crowd of people standing right behind him but the room was empty breathing very fast he turned slowly back to the mirror there he was reflected in it white and scaredlooking and there reflected behind him were at least ten others harry looked over his shoulder  but still no one was there or were they all invisible too was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirrors trick was that it reflected them invisible or not he looked in the mirror again a woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving he reached out a hand and felt the air behind him if she was really there hed touch her their reflections were so close together but he felt only air  she and the others existed only in the mirror she was a very pretty woman she had dark red hair and her eyes  her eyes are just like mine harry thought edging a little closer to the glass bright green  exactly the same shape but then he noticed that she was crying smiling but crying at the same time the tall thin blackhaired man standing next to her put his arm around her he wore glasses and his hair was very untidy it stuck up at the back just as harrys did harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that of his reflection mom he whispered dad they just looked at him smiling and slowly harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror and saw other pairs of green eyes like his other noses like his even a little old man who looked as though he had harrys knobbly knees  harry was looking at his family for the first time in his life the potters smiled and waved at harry and he stared hungrily back at them his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them he had a powerful kind of ache inside him half joy half terrible sadness how long he stood there he didnt know the reflections did not fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his senses he couldnt stay here he had to find his way back to bed he tore his eyes away from his mothers face whispered ill come back and hurried from the room you could have woken me up said ron crossly you can come tonight im going back i want to show you the mirror id like to see your mom and dad ron said eagerly and i want to see all your family all the weasleys youll be able to show me your other brothers and everyone you can see them any old time said ron just come round my house this summer anyway maybe it only shows dead people shame about not finding flamel though have some bacon or something why arent you eating anything harry couldnt eat he had seen his parents and would be seeing them again tonight he had almost forgotten about flamel it didnt seem very important anymore who cared what the three headed dog was guarding what did it matter if snape stole it really are you all right said ron you look odd what harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror room again with ron covered in the cloak too they had to walk much more slowly the next night they tried retracing harrys route from the library wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour im freezing said ron lets forget it and go back no harry hissed i know its here somewhere they passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction but saw no one else just as ron started moaning that his feet were dead with cold harry spotted the suit of armor its here  just here  yes they pushed the door open harry dropped the cloak from around his shoulders and ran to the mirror there they were his mother and father beamed at the sight of him see harry whispered i cant see anything look look at them all there are loads of them i can only see you look in it properly go on stand where i am harry stepped aside but with ron in front of the mirror he couldnt see his family anymore just ron in his paisley pajamas ron though was staring transfixed at his image look at me he said can you see all your family standing around you no  im alone  but im different  i look older  and im head boy what i am  im wearing the badge like bill used to  and im holding the house cup and the quidditch cup  im quidditch captain too ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at harry do you think this mirror shows the future how can it all my family are dead  let me have another look  you had it to yourself all last night give me a bit more time youre only holding the quidditch cup whats interesting about that i want to see my parents dont push me  a sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion they hadnt realized how loudly they had been talking quick ron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of mrs norris came round the door ron and harry stood quite still both thinking the same thing  did the cloak work on cats after what seemed an age she turned and left this isnt safe  she might have gone for filch i bet she heard us come on and ron pulled harry out of the room the snow still hadnt melted the next morning want to play chess harry said ron no why dont we go down and visit hagrid no you go i know what youre thinking about harry that mirror dont go back tonight why not i dunno ive just got a bad feeling about it  and anyway youve had too many close shaves already filch snape and mrs norris are wandering around so what if they cant see you what if they walk into you what if you knock something over you sound like hermione im serious harry dont go but harry only had one thought in his head which was to get back in front of the mirror and ron wasnt going to stop him that third night he found his way more quickly than before he was walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise but he didnt meet anyone and there were his mother and father smiling at him again and one of his grandfathers nodding happily harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror there was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his family nothing at all except  so  back again harry harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice he looked behind him sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than albus dumbledore harry must have walked straight past him so desperate to get to the mirror he hadnt noticed him   i didnt see you sir strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you said dumbledore and harry was relieved to see that he was smiling so said dumbledore slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with harry you like hundreds before you have discovered the delights of the mirror of erised i didnt know it was called that sir but i expect youve realized by now what it does it  well  it shows me my family  and it showed your friend ron himself as head boy how did you know  i dont need a cloak to become invisible said dumbledore gently now can you think what the

had almost given up hope of ever finding flamel in a li brary book even though harry was still sure hed read the name somewhere once term had started they were back to skimming through books for ten minutes during their breaks harry had even less time than the other two because quidditch practice had started again wood was working the team harder than ever even the endless rain that had replaced the snow couldnt dampen his spirits the weasleys complained that wood was becoming a fanatic but harry was on woods side if they won their next match against hufflepuff they would overtake slytherin in the house championship for the first time in seven years quite apart from wanting to win harry found that he had fewer nightmares when he was tired out after training then during one particularly
